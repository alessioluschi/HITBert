974895;0;"(B)(4). (B)(4). THE FOLLOWING PREVIOUSLY INFORMATION WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN MANUFACTURER REPORT #3004209178-2014-04939: [IT WAS REPORTED THAT, BY (B)(6) 2007, THE PATIENT WAS �HAVING PROBLEMS�. THE PATIENT COULDN�T URINATE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) WHERE HIS RIGHT AND LEFT LEGS WENT NUMB. HE ALSO HAD PERIODIC BURNING PAIN IN HIS ABDOMEN. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. THE PATIENT HAD A SPINAL TAP THAT SHOWED PROTEIN IN HIS SPINAL FLUID AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ARACHNOIDITIS. AN MRI WAS DONE AND, 3 DAYS LATER, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PATIENT HAD A GRANULOMA AT THE CATHETER TIP. THE CATHETER WAS REVISED THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE DEVICE SYSTEM WAS USED TO DELIVER DILAUDID AND BUPIVACAINE.] ALL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS EVENT WILL NOW BE REPORTED IN THIS MANUFACTURER REPORT # (3004209178-2014-04939). IT WAS LATER THAT THE PATIENT�S PUMP WAS �INSTALLED� INCORRECTLY, LEAVING THE PATIENT PERMANENTLY PARALYZED FROM THE STERNUM DOWN, INCLUDING THE BOWELS AND BLADDER. THE PATIENT BECAME PARALYZED IN JULY 2007. AN INFLAMMATORY MASS ALSO OCCURRED. THE PATIENT FELT TERRIBLE FROM THE IMPLANT IN MARCH 2007 AND THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER (HCP) KEPT INCREASING THE MEDICATION. THE PATIENT HAD A SPINAL TAP DONE, WHICH SHOWED PROTEIN IN THE SPINAL FLUID. THE PATIENT ALSO HAD AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED ARACHNOIDITIS. AT THAT POINT, THE PUMP REPORTEDLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED OR THE MEDICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED. HOWEVER, THE HCP KEPT INCREASED THE PUMP DOSAGE. WHEN THE PATIENT WOKE UP ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE, HE HAD LOST ALL TRUNK CONTROL AND THE PARALYSIS KEPT PROGRESSING UP. THERE WAS A FEAR THAT IT WAS GOING TO AFFECT THE PATIENT�S LUNGS OR CAUSE THE PATIENT TO BE QUADRIPLEGIC. DUE TO THE PROGRESSION OF THE PATIENT�S PAIN EPISODES AND PARALYSIS, THE PATIENT LOST ALL TRUNK CONTROL. A NEUROLOGIST REVIEWED THE OPTION OF REMOVING THE PUMP ENTIRELY. AT THIS TIME, THE PUMP HAD ONLY BEEN IN FOR 3 MONTHS AND IT HADN�T HAD TIME TO �FUSE� YET. THE NEUROLOGIST STATED IT WAS DANGEROUS TO REMOVE AND THE PATIENT MAY HAVE NEEDED A BLOOD PATCH. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE PATIENT WOULD �GET HIS LEGS BACK� AND, IF HE DID, THERE WAS STILL A CONCERN THAT THE PATIENT WOULD END UP WITH HORRIFIC PAIN AND PARALYSIS AS AN OUTCOME. SO, THE NEUROLOGIST RECOMMENDED LEAVING THE PUMP IMPLANTED, WHICH THEY DID. WHEN THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PARALYZATION, HE WAS INITIALLY DIAGNOSED WITH TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. THE PATIENT SPOKE TO A MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVE AND WAS REFERRED TO A HCP THAT DISCOVERED THAT THE CATHETER WAS IMPLANTED TOO HIGH, AT T9-T10 INSTEAD OF L4. THE MEDICATION AT THIS TIME WAS BUPIVACAINE AND DILAUDID AND FORMED A GRANULOMA AT THAT POINT. THE HCP MOVED THE CATHETER DOWN TO L4. THE PATIENT DID GET MORE FEELING BACK, WHICH WAS REPORTED TO BE PAIN. THERE WAS SPINAL CORD DAMAGE AND THE HCP COULDN�T GO IN TO REMOVE THE GRANULOMA BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE MORE SCAR TISSUE DAMAGE. BY (B)(6) 2007, THE PATIENT COULDN�T URINATE. THE MONDAY AFTER THIS OCCURRED, THE PATIENT WAS TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) AND ALMOST 1800ML OF URINE WAS DRAINED FROM THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT WALKED INTO THE ER WITH HIS LEFT LEG BOTHERING HIM AND WAS ALSO A LITTLE BIT NUMB. AFTER THE URINE WAS DRAINED FROM THE PATIENT, THE PATIENT TRIED TO GET UP OFF OF THE EXAMINATION TABLE AND FELL BECAUSE HE COULDN�T FEEL ANYTHING IN HIS LEFT LEG. THE PATIENT THEN BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE EPISODES OF �BURNING FIRE ICE PAIN� IN HIS ABDOMEN. THE PATIENT THEN LOST USE OF HIS RIGHT LEG. IT WAS NOTED THAT, AT THIS TIME, AN ON-CALL NEUROLOGIST WASN�T AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS SENT TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL AND ADMITTED. THE PATIENT�S HCP CAME TO SEE THE PATIENT AT THE HOSPITAL AND REMOVED THE BUPIVACAINE AND DILAUDID FROM THE PUMP AND REPLACED IT WITH SALINE. AT THIS TIME, THE HCP SAID THAT THE PATIENT SHOULD BE WALKING AGAIN WITHIN THE FOLLOWING 36 HOURS. THIS WAS THE LAST TIME THE PATIENT SPOKE TO THIS HCP. THE HOSPITAL WAS REPORTEDLY TREATING THE PATIENT LIKE HE WAS PARAPLEGIC AND SENT THE PATIENT TO A REHABILITATION FACILITY TO �LEARN HOW TO BE A PARAPLEGIC�. THE PATIENT HAD ANOTHER EPISODE OF �BURNING ICE AND FIRE� PAIN IN HIS ABDOMEN. THESE EPISODES WERE OCCURRING ALMOST EVERY 24 HOURS. THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN SOME MORPHINE, WHICH HELPED HIM CALM DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP. THE PUMP WAS REPLACED IN APRIL 2014 DUE TO �NATURAL� BATTERY DEPLETION. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, THE PATIENT�S LEGS WERE COMPLETELY FLACCID AND HAD NO TONE. THE HCP REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD A PUMP AND CATHETER PLACED AND WITHIN 5 DAYS HAD FLACCID PARALYSIS OF HIS LOWER TORSO, NUMBNESS OF HIS RIB CAGE, AND INCONTINENCE OF BOWEL AND BLADDER. NO DEVICE TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED. THE CATHETER WAS REPOSITIONED IN 2007. AT A RECENT FOLLOW-UP VISIT THE PAIN WAS ""ABOUT THE SAME""; NO COMMENTS REGARDING THE PARALYSIS WERE NOTED. THE PUMP IS USED TO DELIVERY FENTANYL."

THE LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE MILDLY TORTUOUS, MODERATELY CALCIFIED AND 85% STENOTIC LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN ADVANCED THE 2.0 X 20 MM MAVERICK BALLOON TO THE LESION AND ATTEMPTED TO INFLATE THE BALLOON, BUT IT DID NOT INFLATE ""AT ALL"", SO THE PHYSICIAN REMOVED IT AND FOUND THAT THE BALLOON WAS BURST. THE DEVICE WAS ""REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT WITHOUT COMPLICATION"". THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER 2.0 X 20 MM MAVERICK2 BALLOON AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF A NON-BSC STENT. PATIENT STATUS IS REPORTED AS ""GOOD""."
977645;0;THIS EVENT OCCURRED AFTER A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER REPLACED THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY IN THE COUCH, WITH A NEW STYLE BRAKE. INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT IDENTIFIED THAT A LONGER SHAFT KEY IS NEEDED FOR THE FIELD REPLACEMENT BRAKE ASSEMBLY. A NEW SHAFT KEY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE THE FIELD REPLACEMENT BRAKE ASSEMBLY MORE ROBUST. REPLACEMENT PARTS HAVE BEEN UPGRADED WITH A LONGER SHAFT KEY TO PREVENT RECURRENCE. FIELD SERVICE ENGINEERS WILL BE SENT TO ALL ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE HAD A BRAKE REPLACEMENT, WITH THE NEW STYLE BRAKE ASSEMBLY FOR INSPECTION AND INSTALLATION OF THE LONGER SHAFT KEY. THIS ISSUE IS ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER COMPLAINT. MDR 1525965-2007-00028 DOCUMENTING A SIMILAR ISSUE WAS SUBMITTED TO THE FDA ON 11/07/2007. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT SUPPORT COUCH ON A BRILLIANCE 40 SLICE CT SCANNER UNDERWENT UNCONTROLLED VERTICAL MOTION, FOLLOWING A BRAKE REPLACEMENT.
977681;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER SCREEN BECAME FROZEN FOLLOWING INTERROGATION. A SOFT RESET RESOLVED THE ISSUE.
977685;1;"REPORTER INDICATED THAT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PROGRAM THE PATIENT'S DATA PRIOR TO SURGERY, AN ERROR MESSAGE ""FAILED BYTE SEQUENCE"" APPEARED AND THEN THE HANDHELD SCREEN BECAME FROZEN. A RESET WAS PERFORMED, AND WHEN THE COMPUTER RESTARTED, THE SCREEN WAS ""SCATTERED"" AND HAD ""VERTICAL LINES"". ANOTHER HANDHELD WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAMMING. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."
977686;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. REPORTER INDICATED THAT A SITE'S HP HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN ATTEMPTING INTERROGATION, IT APPEARED THAT INTERROGATION WAS ABOUT TO FINISH, BUT THEN WOULD NOT COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THE SITE USED ANOTHER HANDHELD COMPUTER, INTERROGATION WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. THEREFORE THE SITE DETERMINED THAT THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE EVENT.
977696;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT INTERMITTENTLY THE 6800 SYSTEM WILL NOT BOOT UP. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT INTERMITTENTLY THE SYSTEM WILL EXHIBIT NO FLUORO PROBLEMS. A GE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE PERFORMED AN ON SITE INVESTIGATION. THE REPORTED FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. HOWEVER, AS A PROACTIVE MEASURE REPLACED THE CPU BOARD. THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED AND FOUND TO BE WORKING AS INTENDED AND PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE.
977708;0;NO CONCLUSIONS CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS ARE TYPICALLY CAUSED BY OVER-TIGHTENING THE SCREW DURING INSERTION, OR BY TIGHTENING THE NUT ONTO THE SCREW AT AN OBLIQUE ANGLE. CONTACT REPORTS THAT TWO SCREWS WERE DAMAGED DURING TIGHTENING. THE SCREWS WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH OTHERS TO COMPLETE THE CASE. SITUATION RESULTED IN A DELAY TO THE CASE IN EXCESS OF 30-MIN. AS A RESULT AN MDR IS BEING FILED TO DOCUMENTED THIS EVENT.
977766;0;THE FACTORY HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATION, AND THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE UNIT INTERMITTENTLY FAILED TO SHOCK DURING TESTING.
977773;1;REPORTER INDICATED HE WAS HAVING PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH A DELL HANDHELD VNS COMPUTER. THE COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD WERE RETURNED AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PROD ANALYSIS. FURTHER ATTEMPTS FOR INFO ARE IN PROGRESS.

978432;0;(B)(4). CONCOMITANT MEDICAL PRODUCTS: ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER (B)(4). ABBOTT CUSTOMERS REPORTED THE FOLLOWING ISSUES FOR CLINICAL CHEMISTRY BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR: LOW BIAS FOR TOTAL BILIRUBIN QUALITY CONTROL (QC) AND PATIENT RESULTS WITH BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR LOT NUMBER CHANGE RESULTS TRENDING LOW WITH PROFICIENCY SURVEY SAMPLES. INVESTIGATION OF THESE ISSUES DETERMINED THE CALIBRATOR VALUES ASSIGNED TO THE TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENT ((B)(4) AND (B)(4)) CAUSED RESULTS TO TREND DOWNWARD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL CALIBRATOR LOT NUMBERS. WITH A CHANGE FROM CALIBRATOR LOT 38436M100 TO LOT 41456M100 A BIAS OF (-) 7% TO 3% WAS OBSERVED. WITH A CHANGE FROM CALIBRATOR LOT 38436M100 TO LOT 42396M100 A BIAS OF (-) 4% TO 2% WAS OBSERVED. WITH A CHANGE FROM CALIBRATOR LOT 38436M100 TO LOT 48616M100 A BIAS OF (-) 5.5% TO 3.2% WAS OBSERVED. ON (B)(4) 2007 A PRODUCT CORRECTION LETTER ((B)(4)) WAS ISSUED TO ADDRESS BILIRUBIN LOW RECOVERY COMPLAINTS AND PROVIDED CUSTOMERS WITH NEW BILIRUBIN VALUES FOR ALL ON-MARKET CALIBRATOR LOTS. THE NEW BILIRUBIN VALUES WERE ASSIGNED USING THE SECONDARY STANDARD ((B)(4)). (B)(4) WAS IDENTIFIED AS A SOURCE OF VARIABILITY. THE (B)(4) MINIMIZED LOT-TO-LOT VARIABILITY IN THE VALUE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS. FOLLOWING THE USE OF (B)(4) AS A STANDARD FOR THE ASSIGNMENT FOR THE BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR, AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS FOR HIGH RESULTS FOR TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENTS ((B)(4)AND (B)(4)) WAS OBSERVED: HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RESULTS ON PROFICIENCY SURVEY SAMPLES, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED QUALITY CONTROL (QC) RECOVERY, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED PATIENT RESULTS. AN INVESTIGATION WAS INITIATED FOR THE TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENTS ((B)(4) AND (B)(4)), WHICH DETERMINED THE MATRIX OF THE SECONDARY STANDARD USED IN THE VALUE ASSIGNMENT OF THE CALIBRATOR IS SENSITIVE TO THE (B)(4) METHOD IN THE ABBOTT TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENTS ((B)(4) AND (B)(4)). THE MATRIX OF THIS SECONDARY STANDARD CAUSED A POSITIVE BIAS. BECAUSE OF THESE FINDINGS, A NEW TOTAL BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR VALUE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR USE WITH THE TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENTS. THE REVISED VALUES LOWERED TOTAL BILIRUBIN RESULTS UP TO 18%. THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED REFERENCE METHOD FOR TOTAL BILIRUBIN, HOWEVER LITERATURE REFERENCES DOCUMENT ONGOING EFFORTS OF STANDARDIZATION. ABBOTT HAS SELECTED A TOTAL BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR VALUE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS USED BY (B)(4) FOR (B)(4) SURVEY SAMPLES. ACCURACY OF THE NEW PROCESS WAS CONFIRMED USING THE (B)(4) METHOD MODIFIED BY (B)(4). THE IMPROVED VALUE ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE REMAINS TRACEABLE TO (B)(4) AND DEMONSTRATES MINIMAL SENSITIVITY TO MATRIX VARIABILITY. ALIGNMENT OF THE STANDARDIZATION DIRECTLY TO THE (B)(4) WITH CONFIRMATION OF TOTAL BILIRUBIN COMMUTABILITY TO THE (B)(4) METHOD IMPROVES THE VALUE ASSIGNMENT ACCURACY. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE MATRIX ISSUES FOR TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENT ((B)(4)) RELATED TO THE COMMUTABILITY OF VARIOUS SAMPLES ((B)(4), (B)(4), BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR, AND PATIENT SAMPLES) DUE TO THE PRODUCTION MATERIALS USED, E.G. HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN (HSA) VS. BOVINE SERUM ALBUMIN (BSA). THIS MATRIX EFFECT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVER-RECOVERY OBSERVED BY CUSTOMERS DURING THE CONVERSION TO THE (B)(4). THE CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH TESTING USING AN EXTERNAL REFERENCE (B)(4) AND (B)(4) METHOD. AS A CORRECTIVE/PREVENTIVE MEASURE, ALL ON-MARKET BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR LOTS WERE RE-VALUE ASSIGNED PER THE NEW VALUE ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE PROVIDING IMPROVED ACCURACY FOR TOTAL BILIRUBIN REAGENTS. THESE VALUES WERE COMMUNICATED IN THE CUSTOMER LETTER ISSUED ON (B)(4) 2008 ((B)(4)). IN ADDITION, ABBOTT (B)(4) HAS RE-WRITTEN AND VALIDATED THE PROCEDURE FOR BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR. VALUE ASSIGNMENT AND VALUE VERIFICATION INCLUDED: CLARIFIED PROCEDURE FOR PRIMARY (B)(4) PREPARATION AND INCREASING REPLICATES TO IMPROVING ACCURACY, REVALIDATED THE PROCEDURE. REASSIGNED OF (B)(4) USING IN-HOUSE PREPARED (B)(4) TO ALLOW FOR LESS VARIABILITY FROM ONE ASSIGNMENT TO ANOTHER. ASSIGNED THE VALUES FOR BILIRUBIN CALIBRATOR USING REASSIGNED (B)(4) BY IN-HOUSE PREPARED (B)(4) PER (B)(4) AND (B)(4) METHOD. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED, WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THEY FAILED A RECENT CEQAL PROFICIENCY SURVEY FOR THE DIRECT BILIRUBIN ASSAY ON THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER. THE CUSTOMER NOTED THAT THEY COMPARED WELL TO THEIR PEER GROUP, BUT HAD ELEVATED RESULTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE METHOD MEAN. THERE IS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.

THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCED A ""RESIDUAL FLUID FOUND IN WBC CUP"" ERROR MESSAGE WHILE DECONTAMINATING. FIELD SERVICE WAS DISPATCHED TO RUN ANOTHER DECONTAMINATION AND REPLACED THE WBC REAGENT A, WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUE. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. (B)(4). ANALYZER (B)(4). EVALUATION METHOD: MICROBIAL TESTING OF OPENED/UNOPENED REAGENTS AND RETENTION LOTS. EVALUATION RESULTS: WBC REAGENT PART A (LIST 01H77-01, LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2). THERE IS NO 510(K) NUMBER FOR CELL-DYN WBC REAGENT A. THE 510(K) FILED WITH THE INITIAL MDR REFLECTS THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE. THE CELL-DYN 4000 AND CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZERS WERE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED WBC BACKGROUND COUNTS IN THE FIELD. BACKGROUND COUNTS WERE RECOVERING UP TO 0.5 X 103/UL .THE SPECIFICATION FOR WBC BACKGROUND READINGS IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.10X103/UL PER THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE OPERATOR'S MANUAL, LIST NUMBER 08H10-01, REVISION D AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL, LIST NUMBER 01H25-01, REVISION M.

IF THE OPERATOR PROCEEDS TO RUN PATIENT SAMPLES WITH BACKGROUND COUNTS OUT OF SPECIFICATION, RESULTS MAY EXHIBIT FLUORESCENT PARTICLE FLAGGING, FLUORESCENT CHANNEL 3 FLAGS, RESISTANT RBC FLAGS, INCREASED NUCLEATED RBC FLAGS OR ABNORMAL WBC HISTOGRAM SCATTER PLOTS. IF PRODUCT LABELING IS NOT FOLLOWED AND PATIENT RESULTS ARE REPORTED, WBC RESULTS MAY BE INACCURATE AND HIGHER THAN ACTUAL RESULTS; HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PATIENT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE DETECTED MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION IN THE WBC REAGENT PART A, LIST NUMBER 01H77-01, WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED FOR USE WITH THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS IDENTIFIED ONLY ON LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2 OF WBC REAGENT PART A, LIST NUMBER 01H77-01. THE CONTAMINANT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO BE PSEUDOMONAS SPECIES, AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATE COMMON IN BIO-FILMS, AND DOES NOT PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION, SPORADIC IN NATURE, CAN AFFECT OTHER LOTS OF WBC REAGENT PART A, AS MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WITHIN THE WBC REAGENT PART A CAN FURTHER CONTAMINATE THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEMS. THE SOURCE OF THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF FILTRATION OF WATER USED FOR CLEANING PROCEDURES, BIOFILM SHEDDING IN THE FILL LINE, INCREASED BIOBURDEN DUE TO STAGNANT ZONES IN THE FILL-LINE AREA AND FAILURE TO ACCURATELY DETECT CONTAMINATION AS PART OF PRODUCT RELEASE. THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION: ALL THREE AFFECTED LOTS WERE RECALLED FROM THE FIELD AND CUSTOMERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO DECONTAMINATE THEIR INSTRUMENTS PRIOR TO USING ANY NEW WBC REAGENT PART A. INCORPORATION OF AN IMPROVED MICROBIAL TESTING METHOD INTO THE CURRENT PROCESS. INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SANITIZATION IN THE FILL-LINE AREA, INCLUDING FILTRATION OF THE WATER USED FOR CLEANING-IN-PLACE PROCEDURES. INCREASED FLUSHING OF THE FILL-LINE EQUIPMENT AND AUTOCLAVING OF FILL-LINE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS NOZZLES. COMPLETION OF THE FINAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE END OF (B)(6) 2008. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ONLY IN WBC PART A REAGENT, LIST NUMBER 01H77-01, FOR LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2 AND 56675I2; HOWEVER, IF THE INSTRUMENT IS NOT PROPERLY DECONTAMINATED, THE CONTAMINATED WBC REAGENT PART A HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS AND CAN THEN BACK-CONTAMINATE OTHER BOTTLES OF WBC REAGENT PART A PLACED ON THE CONTAMINATED INSTRUMENT. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE."

984851;1;THE REPORTED ISSUE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THE EVENT INCLUDING A CONFIRMED DATE/TIME OF DEATH, CAUSE OF DEATH, PT IDENTIFIERS AND MORE INFO ABOUT THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE SITUATION HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FROM THE REPORTING SITE. THE SITE HAS ATTRIBUTED THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT TO A TECHNOLOGIST INCORRECTLY LABELING THE KODAK CR CASSETTE WITH ANOTHER PT'S NAME AT THE PT'S BEDSIDE. THE SITE HAS NOT INDICATED THERE WAS ANY FAILURE OF THE GE PACS SYSTEM TO PERFORM AS DESIGNED. THE DATA WAS REPORTEDLY DISPLAYED AND HANDLED PROPERLY WITHIN THE PACS SYSTEM, BUT DUE TO HUMAN ERROR WAS INCORRECTLY ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM, AND THE ERROR WAS APPARENTLY NOT IDENTIFIED DURING USER VERIFICATION STEPS PRIOR TO BEING INPUT INTO THE PACS SYSTEM. GE HAS OFFERED IT'S ASSISTANCE IN ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT THAT THE SITE MAY NEED INCLUDING REVIEWING THE CONFIGURATION AND/OR USAGE HISTORY OF THEIR PACS SYSTEM. GE HAS ALSO NOTIFIED KODAK OF THIS EVENT. SHOULD ADDITIONAL INFO BE ACQUIRED, A FOLLOW UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. A TECHNOLOGIST PERFORMED A PORTABLE X-RAY EXAM AT A PT'S BEDSIDE USING A KODAK COMPUTER RADIOGRAPHY SYSTEM. THE FACILITY REPORTED THAT THEY MISTAKENLY LABELED THE WRONG PT NAME ON THE CASSETTE AT THE BEDSIDE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY UPLOADED THE SAME INCORRECT INFO TO THE GE CENTRICITY PACS SYSTEM. THE STUDY WAS MISTAKENLY LOADED INTO THE PACS SYSTEM UNDER A MALE PT'S NAME (INSTEAD OF THE FEMALE PT THE EXAM WAS CONDUCTED ON). WHEN THE IMAGE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED USING GE'S PACS SYSTEM, IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MALE PT INSTEAD OF THE CORRECT FEMALE PT. THE MALE PT (WHOM THE IMAGING STUDY WAS NOT INTENDED FOR) REPORTEDLY RECEIVED AN INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS AS A RESULT OF THE PRECEDING EVENTS. THIS SITUATION RESULTED IN A TUBE BEING PLACED DOWN THE PT'S THROAT, WHICH REPORTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DEATH. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIS DEATH ARE UNK AT THIS TIME AND AN INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. THE FACILITY REPORTED THAT THE PACS SYSTEM CORRECTLY DISPLAYED THE INFO THAT WAS PROVIDED TO IT, BUT DUE TO USER ERROR IN UPLOADING THE INCORRECT INFO, IT WAS FOR THE WRONG PT.

986026;1;IN 2007, A CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN USING ISITE PACS TO PERFORM MPR, THE LEFT AND RIGHT ORIENTATION MARKERS WERE BEING DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE REVERSE ORIENTATION MARKER DISPLAY AFFECTS ONLY RECONSTRUCTED CORONAL AND SAGITTAL IMAGES WHEN THE ISITE MPR FEATURE IS USED IF THE PT WAS SCANNED AS SUPINE FEET FIRST, PRONE HEAD FIRST OR PRONE FEET FIRST. ADDITIONALLY, THE ORDERING OF CORONAL AND SAGITTAL IMAGE SLICES CAN ALSO BE REVERSE. FOR EXAMPLE, A SCOUT LINE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF AN AXIAL IMAGE COULD INTENTIONALLY DISPLAY THE CORRESPONDING SAGITTAL SLICE POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. SUBSEQUENT IN-HOUSE TESTING REVEALED THAT THE REPORTED ISSUE IS REPRODUCIBLE. THE ORIGINAL AXIAL SLICES ARE ALWAYS DISPLAYED AND ANNOTATED CORRECTLY IN ALL CASES. THE ORIGINAL DICOM IMAGES ARE ON ISITE PACS AND PRESENTED IN CORRECT ORIENTATION NEXT TO THE MPR IMAGES WHEN THEY ARE DISPLAYED ON THE MONITOR. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF PT INJURY RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. ADD'L EVALUATION INCLUDED ENGINEERING REVIEW OF THE CODE THAT HANDLES MPR IMAGE ORIENTATION. AFTER INVESTIGATING THIS SITUATION, IT IS PHILIPS' OPINION THAT THERE IS MINIMAL RISK OF PT INJURY IF THE MPR (RECONSTRUCTED) IMAGE IS INCORRECTLY DISPLAYED IN ISITE PACS BECAUSE: THE ORIGINAL (CORRECT) IMAGE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN THE PT TIMELINE. THE ORIGINAL (CORRECT) IMAGE IS ALWAYS DISPLAYED ON THE MONITOR NEXT TO THE POSSIBLE INCORRECT IMAGE (NOT ALL MPRS ARE INCORRECT, ONLY THOSE IMAGES THAT ARE ACQUIRED AS DESCRIBED. ANATOMICAL MARKERS ARE OFTEN PRESENT (MAKING IDENTIFICATION OF THE INCORRECT DISPLAY LIKELY).

SAME CASE AS MFR #2134265-2008-00357. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, STENT THROMBOSIS AND PATIENT DEATH OCCURRED. THE PT PRESENTED IN 06/07 WITH CHEST PAIN, AND A 50-99% STENOSIS WAS FOUND IN THE PROXIMAL AND MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD). THE TARGET VESSEL HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT 3-3.5MM. IN 2007, THE PHYSICIAN PREDILATED THE LESION WITH AN 2.5MM BALLOON (UNKNOWN TYPE) AT 6 ATMS, AND THEN IMPLANTED A 3.50X28MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT AND A 3.00X20MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENT. THE TWO STENTS WERE OVERLAPPING. THE STENTS WERE CONFIRMED WITH IVUS AND THE CHEST PAIN WAS RESOLVED. THE STENTS WERE WELL POSITIONED AND WELL APPOSED. PENALDINE AND BAYASPIRIN WERE GIVEN BEFORE AND DURING THE PROCEDURE. TWENTY SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PT RETURNED FOR AN ENDOSCOPY OF THE COLON, DURING WHICH NIFLEC WAS USED. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS IN A COLD SWEAT SO IT WAS STOPPED, AND THE MELAENA WAS RESOLVED TO THE PT DIDN'T GO TO GASTROENTEROLOGICAL MEDICINE. FIVE DAYS LATER, THE PT WAS TAKEN OFF OF PANALDINE AND PUT ON PLETAAL BECAUSE OF LEUCOPENIA. THREE MONTHS LATER, CANCER WAS DIAGNOSED IN THE SIGMOID, AND THE NEXT MONTH THE PHYSICIAN OPERATED ON THE SIGMOID. THE PT WAS TAKEN OFF OF ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE AND STARTED ON A HEPARIN DRIP. AFTER RETURNING TO THE ROOM AFTER SURGERY, VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION OCCURRED AND PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS SUPPORT (PCPS) AND AN INTRA AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP) WERE INSERTED TO THE PT. CARDIAC MUSCLE DAMAGE WAS NOTED WITH ECG AND A THROMBOSIS WAS NOTED AT THE DISTAL SIDE OF THE 3.00X20MM TAXUS STENT AND AT THE PROXIMAL SIDE OF THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE THROMBOSIS IN THE LAD WAS ASPIRATED AND THEN DILATED WITH A 2.5MM BALLOON (TYPE UNKNOWN). ANGIOGRAPHY NOTED HAZY IMAGINE, SO PLAIN OLD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED, AND FLOW WAS RESTORED. THE THROMBOSIS IN THE RCA WAS ASPIRATED AND DILATED WITH A 2.5MM BALLOON (TYPE UNKNOWN). A NON-BSC BARE METAL STENT WAS IMPLANTED, AND FLOW WAS RESTORED. PANALDINE AND BAYASPIRIN WERE GIVEN. FOUR DAYS LATER, CARDIAC FUNCTION RECOVERED AND THE PT WAS TAKEN OFF OF PCPS. IABP WAS REMOVED AT AN UNKNOWN DATE. FOURTEEN DAYS LATER, THE PT DIED. THE PHYSICIAN FEELS THAT THE DEATH WAS UNRELATED TO THE TAXUS STENTS AND WAS DUE TO AN INFLAMMATION LIKE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OF THE LUNGS.

996452;0;I HAD AN XLIFT PROCEDURE, USING A CORENT SYSTEM IN 2006, AND I WAS IN THE HOSP, AND I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT SEVERE PAIN DOWN MY LEGS ECT., RIGHT AFTER THE SURGERY WAS PERFORMED. THIS ONE EVENT LED TO RE-ADMITTANCE INTO THE HOSP NOT ONE WEEK LATER, WHICH LED TO MORE SURGERIES TO HELP ME. I ENDED UP WITH SEVEN SURGERIES SINCE 2006, BECAUSE I WAS INFORMED THAT THE DEVICE EITHER SLIPPED OR MOVED OUT, AND IT SNAPPED MY VERTEBRAE AND MOVED TOWARD THE AORTIC AREA. I HAVE SINCE BEEN PHYSICALLY PERMANENTLY DISABLED AND HAVE HAD TO BE FUSED FROM THE TOP THORACIC THROUGH MY PELVIS IN THE FRONT AND THE BACK AND I AM LEFT WITH PERMANENT CHRONIC PAIN IN THE THORACIC AREA FROM BACK TO FRONT, DOWN MY LEG AND CANNOT WALK OR STAND OR SIT FOR MORE THAN 10-15 MINS OF WHICH I AM STILL IN PAIN. THEY HAVE EVEN PLACED A SPINAL STIMULANT IN ME AS A LAST DITCH EFFORT WHICH ONLY HAS ALLEVIATED ABOUT 10% OF THE PAIN DOWN MY LEGS AND BUTTOCKS AREA. BEFORE THE SURGERY IN 2006, I WAS WORKING FULL-TIME AND WALKING, AND NOW I AM BEING TOLD THERE IS NOTHING MORE THE SURGEONS CAN DO FOR ME. I AM NOW WEARING A FULL BODY BRACE EVERYDAY FOR SUPPORT AS WELL. WOULD APPRECIATE SPEAKING TO SOMEONE ASAP. I AM NOW FUSED FROM THORACIC TO PELVIS. I AM NOT SURE OF WHAT TYPE OF IMPLEMENTATION WAS USED. DATES OF USE: 2006 - 2007. DIAGNOSIS OR REASON FOR USE: SLIPPED DISK AT L2-L3.
996685;1;THE ISSUE INVOLVES FUNCTIONALITY IN CERNER MILLENNIUM POWERCHART POWERORDERS AND AFFECTS USERS THAT UTILIZE THE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORD. IF A PRO RE NATA (PRN) MEDICATION ORDER IS MODIFIED TO A SCHEDULED ORDER AND BACK TO PRN, THE LAST GIVEN DATE AND TIME ARE DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY FOR THE TASK. THIS ISSUE OCCURS IF AN ADMINISTRATION OR EVENT WAS DOCUMENTED WHILE THE MEDICATION WAS A NON-PRN ORDER. THE SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS ADMINISTRATION AS THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, AND INCORRECT INFO IS DISPLAYED IN THE LAST GIVEN DETAIL. PT CARE COULD BE AFFECTED IF A CLINICIAN BASES THE LAST ADMINISTRATION OFF OF THE INCORRECT LAST GIVEN DATE AND TIME, AS A MEDICATION DOSE COULD BE GIVEN WITHOUT THE PROPER TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN DOSES. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF ANY ADVERSE PT EVENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. CERNER HAS DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION 2008 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES.

996715;1;"DURING INHOUSE TESTING AN ISSUE WAS FOUND IN THE SUNQUEST BLOOD BANK/BLOOD DONOR MODULES IN THE BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING (BPT) APPLICATION. THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS MUST OCCUR WITHIN THE SAME ENTRY SESSION. THE PRODUCT TESTING RESULT KEYBOARD IS USED. THE USER ENTERS AN UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT TEST RESULT AND THEN CHOOSES TO REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT TEST RESULT. THE USER THEN 'CANCELS' OUT OF THE DIALOG BOX TO ADD REFLEX TESTING AND/OR DEFERRAL (S). THE USER 'SAVES' THE SESSION. THE SYSTEM IS INCORRECTLY RETAINING THE INITIAL RESULT INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE PRODUCT TEST PENDING. AN OUTCOME OF RETAINING THE INITIAL UNACCEPTABLE RESULT IS THAT UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT RESULT PROCESSING (I.E. REFLEX ORDERING AND/OR GENERATE DONOR DEFERRAL (S) AS PRE-DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE BY HER USER), IS NOT GENERATED ON THE INITIAL UNACCEPTABLE RESULT THAT IS RETAINED. DONOR DEFERRALS ARE ONLY GENERATED WHEN CLIENTS HAVE THE SUNQUEST BLOOD DONOR SYSTEM. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND DURING INHOUSE TESTING. NO CLIENTS HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE. WHEN USING THE PRODUCT TESTING KEYBOARD WITHIN THE SAME ENTRY SESSION IN BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING (BPT), IF THE USER CHOOSES TO DELETE AN UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT TEST RESULT AND REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT TEST RESULT THEN CANCELS AND SAVES, THE SYSTEM IS RETAINING THE INITIAL RESULT AND DOES NOT PERFORM UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT RESULT PROCESSING (I.E. REFLEX ORDERING AND/OR GENERATE DEFERRAL (S) AS DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE BMA 10:3) ON THE INITIAL UNACCEPTABLE RESULT THAT IS INCORRECTLY RETAINED. TERMS: PRODUCT TESTING KEYBOARDS ARE DEFINED IN BMA 4:3:1, 'PRODUCT TESTING KEYBOARD DEFINITION MAINTENANCE' TO ASSIGN TEST CODES AND/OR RESULTS (COMMENTS) TO SPECIFIC KEYS TO STREAMLINE THE ENTRY OF RESULTS FOR THE PRODUCT. UNACCEPTABLE PRODUCT RESULT PROCESSING (BMA 10:3): THE UNACCEPTABLE RESULT PROCESSING TABLE ALLOWS CLIENTS TO DEFINE RESULTS TO PRODUCT TESTING THAT ARE TO BE CONSIDERED UNACCEPTABLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. CLIENTS ALSO CAN DEFINE THAT THE SYSTEM ADDS CONFIRMATORY OR REPEAT TESTING AND GENERATES DONOR DEFERRALS. DONOR DEFERRALS CAN ONLY BE DEFINED IF CLIENTS HAVE THE SUNQUEST BLOOD DONOR SYSTEM. A MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED IF A RESULT DEFINED AS UNACCEPTABLE IS ENTERED IN BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING. IF THE WARNING IS CONFIRMED, THE SYSTEM ADDS A TEST (S) OR GENERATES A DEFERRAL(S) FOR THE DONOR. COMPLETED BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING WORKSHEETS ARE CALLED USING BLOOD BANK REPORTS (BBR) 3:1. BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING WORKSHEETS PROVIDES TECHNOLOGIST WORKSHEETS FOR TESTS TO BE PERFORMED ON UNITS. COMPLETE WORKSHEETS CONTAIN ONLY THOSE UNIT NUMBERS THAT HAVE ALL TESTS RESULTED FOR THE SPECIFIC WORKSHEET(S) REQUESTED. WORKFLOW: PRECONDITIONS- THE TEST HEPATITIS IS DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE (BMA10:3) WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE RESULTS OF 'POSITIVE' AND 'INDETERMINATE' TO GENERATE DEFERRALS AND REFLEX ORDER ADDITIONAL TESTING. THE PRODUCT TESTING KEYBOARD HAS KEYS DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE (BMA 4:3:1) FOR A RESULT OF 'POS' (POSITIVE) AND 'INDET' (INDETERMINATE). ENTER A UNIT INTO THE SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES THE TEST HEPATITIS TO BE RESULTED. IN THE BLOOD PRODUCT TESTING FUNCTION, NAVIGATE TO THE HEPATITIS TEST RESULT FIELD. RESULT THE TEST WITH 'POS' BY PRESSING THE APPROPRIATE KEY ON THE KEYBOARD. UNACCEPTABLE RESULT PROCESSING RULES ARE EXECUTED. THE SYSTEM DISPLAYS THE ADDITIONAL TEST(S) TO BE ADDED AND THE DEFERRAL(S) TO BE GENERATED. THE USER CLICKS 'YES' TO CONFIRM. THE SYSTEM ADDS THE REFLEX ORDER(S) AND GENERATES THE DEFERRAL(S) CORRECTLY. THE USER PUTS FOCUS BACK ON THE RESULT OF 'POS'. THE USER MODIFIES THE HEPATITIS TEST RESULT FROM 'POS' TO 'INDET' BY PRESSING THE APPROPRIATE KEY ON THE KEYBOARD. THE SYSTEM DISPLAYS A MESSAGE ASKING TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS UNACCEPTABLE RESULT OF 'POS'. THE USER CLICKS 'YES' TO CONFIRM REMOVAL. UNACCEPTABLE RESULT PROCESSING RULES ARE EXECUTED FOR THE RESULT 'INDET.' THE SYSTEM DISPLAYS THE ADDITIONAL TEST(S) TO BE ADDED AND TH DEFERRAL(S) TO BE GENERATED. USING THE MOUSE THE USER CLICKS 'NO' TO CANCEL ADDING THE REFLEX TESTING AND DEFERRAL(S). THE SYSTEM NOW DISPLAYS A RESULT OF 'POS' WITH A DESCRIPTION OF 'INDETERMINATE.' NOTE: THE SYSTEM SHOULD REMOVE THE RESULT 'POS' AND THE RESULT REMAIN PENDING. THE ISSUE IS THAT 'POS' IS RETAINED BY THE SYSTEM AND DOES NOT REMAIN PENDING. NOTE: THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WILL DEVIATE WHEN USING THE ACCELERATOR KEYS AND NOT THE MOUSE; HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME IS THE SAME. SAVE THE DATA. NOTE: THE SYSTEM DOES NOT PERFORM UNACCEPTABLE RESULT PROCESSING FOR THE UNACCEPTABLE RESULT 'POS' THAT WAS INCORRECTLY RETAINED BY THE SYSTEM. THE USER ACCESSES THE UNIT IN BLOOD TESTING REVIEW FUNCTION. THE PRODUCT TESTING RESULT IS INCORRECTLY DISPLAYED AS 'POSITIVE.' NOTE: THE HEPATITIS TEST RESULT SHOULD BE PENDING DUE TO STEP 14 ABOVE. THE UNACCEPTABLE RESULT COUNT IS INCORRECT. NO CONFIRMATORY TEST(S) WERE ADDED. NO DEFERRAL(S) WAS GENERATED. THE SYSTEM DOES NOT DISPLAY THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES IN THE 'NOTICE' COLUMN ON THE ROW OF THE UNACCEPTABLE HEPATITIS RESULT OF 'POSITIVE.' ""UNACCEPTABLE RESULT'; ""TESTING ADDED""; ""DEFERRAL GENERATED"". IF THE USER CHOOSES TO CONTINUE AND UPDATES THE UNIT STATUS TO AVAILABLE AND THE HEPATITIS UNACCEPTABLE RESULT OF 'POSITIVE' IS SAVED; THE SYSTEM DOES NOT GENERATE THE FOLLOWING QA FAILURES: 'ACTIVE DEFERRAL(S) ON FILE FOR DONOR OF UNIT.' 'UNIT STATUS UPDATED TO INVENTORY WITH UNACCEPTABLE RESULTS ON FILE.' TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM OCCURRING IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER 'CANCEL' THE BPT SESSION PRIOR TO 'SAVING' THEN RESELECT THE UNIT AND ENTER THE CORRECT RESULT INSTEAD OF ENTERING AND REPLACING UNACCEPTABLE RESULTS IN THE SAME ENTRY SESSION. PRIOR TO 'SAVING,' REVIEW ALL RESULTS TO CONFIRM UNACCEPTABLE RESULT PROCESSING OCCURRED FOR ANY UNACCEPTABLE RESULT.

998122;1;"PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM. IN THE FUNCTION BLOOD ORDER PROCESSING (BOP/BOPW), WHEN REACTION RESULT GRIDS ARE ENABLED, QUALITY ASSURANCE MESSAGES ""UNIT COMPATIBLY REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" AND ""SPECIMEN REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" ARE NOT GENERATED UNDER THE FOLLOWING ATYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCE. SCENARIO #1: WHEN AN ACCESSION NUMBER IS RE-ENTERED THAT HAS PENDING REACTION RESULTS WITH AN INTERPRETATION ALREADY ON FILE AND ""SAVE"" IS SELECTED AGAIN. IN THE FUNCTION BLOOD ORDER PROCESSING (BOP), WHEN REACTION RESULT GRIDS ARE ENABLED, QUALITY ASSURANCE MESSAGE ""SPECIMEN REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" IS NOT GENERATED UNDER THE FOLLOWING ATYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SCENARIO #2: DURING THE INITIAL ENTRY OF AN ACCESSION NUMBER AND ""SAVE"" IS SELECTED WITH THE FOLLOWING: PARTIAL OR COMPLETE REACTION RESULTS ARE ENTERED. THE TEST HAS A RESULT INTERPRETATION OF HIDE. NOTE: THE TEXT CODE HIDE TRANSLATES TO ""DO NOT REPORT"" THERE ARE NO REACTION RESULTS AND TEST INTERPRETATION PATTERN MATCH DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE FOR THE TEST RESULT INTERPRETATION ENTERED. NOTE: BOTH QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES ARE USED TO DISQUALIFY A PATIENT/UNIT FROM COMPUTER ASSISTED CROSSMATCH (CAX) ELIGIBILITY. FOR CLIENTS USING CAX, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN SCENARIOS #1 AND #2 THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES ARE NOT EXECUTED, SO A PATIENT/UNIT WILL INAPPROPRIATELY QUALIFY FOR CAX. SCENARIO #1 WAS FOUND DURING IN HOUSE TESTING BY QUALITY CONTROL STAFF AT THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE CORRECT QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES ARE GENERATED DURING THE INITIAL ENTRY SESSION. SCENARIO #2 WAS FOUND IN THE TEST AREA OF A CLIENT SITE. NO PATIENT HARM WAS REPORTED. BACKGROUND: IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE, THE USER IS ABLE TO DEFINE PATTERNS FOR PHASE RESULTS AND AN INTERPRETATION FOR TESTS THAT ARE USED TO VALIDATE RESULTS ENTERED INTO THE APPLICATION. THE TEXT CODE HIDE CAN BE DEFINED IN MAINTENANCE TO SUPPRESS THE TEST RESULT FROM PRINTING ON PATIENT REPORTS. A TEST INTERPRETATION OF HIDE IS MOST OFTEN USED TO RESULT TESTS THAT WERE ADDED TO AN ORDER IN ERROR. RESULTING THE TEST WITH HIDE TRANSLATES TO 'DO NOT REPORT' ON INTERNAL LABORATORY REPORTS. TWO QUALITY ASSURANCE WARNINGS/FAILURES CHECK THAT THE PHASE RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS MATCH THE PREDEFINED REACTION RESULTS IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE. IF REACTION RESULTS ENTERED FOR A PHASE DO NOT MATCH TEST RESULT INTERPRETATIONS, A PATTERN MATCH DOES NOT OCCUR AND THE QUALITY ASSURANCE WARNINGS/FAILURES WILL EXECUTE. ""UNIT COMPATIBLY REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" (QA #21). ""SPECIMEN REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" (QA #22). THE QA #21 AND #22 WARNINGS ARE MESSAGES THAT ARE DISPLAYED WHEN THE USER ENTERS REACTION RESULT PATTERNS THAT DO NOT MATCH WITH THE TEST RESULT INTERPRETATION. THE QA #21 AND #22 FAILURES ARE DISPLAYED WHEN THE DATA IS SAVED/FILED. THE USER MUST ACKNOWLEDGE ALL WARNINGS AND OVERRIDE ALL FAILURES. TO OVERRIDE THE FAILURES, THE USER NEEDS TO HAVE APPROPRIATE SECURITY. THIS OVERRIDE MAY REQUIRE THE ENTRY OF A REASON CODE. NOTE: FOR SOME QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES, SECURITY CAN BE DEFINED TO NOT ALLOW AN OVERRIDE. WITHIN AN APPLICATION, THE USER RESULTS A TEST (I.E. CROSSMATCH) THAT HAS AN INTERPRETATION (I.E. COMPATIBLE) DEFINED FOR PHASE RESULTS (I.E. IMMEDIATE SPIN, LIS INCUBATION, ANTI-HUMAN GLOBULIN AND CHECK CELLS). THE ENTRIES OF THE PHASE AND INTERPRETATION RESULTS ARE DONE THROUGH A REACTION GRID. SINCE A PATTERN MATCH IS BASED ON THE PHASE RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION, ENTERING AN INTERPRETATION WITHOUT PHASE RESULTS IS ATYPICAL. BOTH QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES REFERENCED ARE USED TO DISQUALIFY A PATIENT/UNIT FROM COMPUTER ASSISTED CROSSMATCH (CAX) ELIGIBILITY. FOR CLIENTS USING CAX, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IF THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES ARE NOT GENERATED, A PATIENT/UNIT WILL INAPPROPRIATELY QUALIFY FOR CAX. PROBLEM: SCENARIO #1: IN THE FUNCTION BLOOD ORDERING PROCESS (BOP/BOPW), WHEN RE-ACCESSING AN ACCESSION NUMBER THAT HAS MULTIPLE UNITS WITH PENDING REACTION RESULTS ALONG WITH AN INTERPRETATION AND ""SAVE"" IS SELECTED, THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURE ""UNIT COMPATIBLY REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" IS ONLY RE-EXECUTED FOR THE FIRST TEST ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST UNIT IN THE DISPLAY. IN THE FUNCTION BLOOD ORDERING PROCESS (BOP/BOPW), WHEN RE-ACCESSING AN ACCESSION NUMBER THAT HAS A PATIENT SPECIMEN TEST WITH PENDING REACTION RESULTS ALONG WITH AN INTERPRETATION AND ""SAVE IS SELECTED, THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURE ""SPECIMEN REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" IS NOT RE-EXECUTED. IN BOTH WORKFLOWS DESCRIBED, IF COMPUTER ASSISTED CROSSMATCH (CAX) IS USED, QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES ARE NOT EXECUTED; A PATIENT/UNIT WILL INAPPROPRIATELY QUALIFY FOR CAX. SCENARIO #2: IN THE FUNCTION BLOOD ORDERING PROCESS (BOP/BOPW) DURING THE INITIAL ENTRY SESSION, THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURE ""SPECIMEN REACTION ENTRY DOES NOT MATCH SYSTEM INTERPRETATION"" IS NOT GENERATED WHEN THE REACTION RESULT PATTERN ENTERED DOES NOT MATCH A PATTERN DEFINED IN BLOOD BANK MAINTENANCE, THE INTERPRETATION IS ENTERED AS HIDE AND ""SAVE"" IS SELECTED. IN THE WORKFLOW DESCRIBED, IF COMPUTER ASSISTED CROSSMATCH (CAX) IS USED, QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURE IS NOT EXECUTED; A PATIENT/UNIT WILL INAPPROPRIATELY QUALIFY FOR CAX."

DURING THE IMPLANTATION OF THE LEXOS VR, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO TERMINATE VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION WITH A 20-J AND A 30-J SHOCK. FOLLOWING THIS, 360-J SHOCKS WERE DELIVERED WITH AN EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR, OF WHICH THE THIRD EXTERNAL SHOCK TERMINATED THE VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION. THE SHOCK IMPEDANCES OF THE 20-J AND THE 30-J SHOCKS WERE NORMAL WITH 45 AND 44 OHM. NEXT, AN SQ ARRAY LEAD WAS PLACED, AND A LUMAX 340 VR-T WAS USED INSTEAD OF THE LEXOS VR. VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION WAS AGAIN TRIGGERED IN THE PT. THE ICD DELIVERED A 30-J AND A 40-J SHOCK, AGAIN WITHOUT TERMINATION OF THE VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION. THE SHOCK IMPEDANCES WERE NORMAL WITH 65 OHM. IN REACTION, IT WAS AGAIN SHOCKED WITH AN EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR. MULTIPLE SHOCKS WITH 360 J WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING REANIMATION ATTEMPTS AND CONNECTION TO THE HEART-LUNG MACHINE. THE PT DIED IN THE OPERATING ROOM. THE TWO ICDS WERE NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS BUT PROVIDENTLY KEPT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ALSO REPORTED: LUMAX 340 VR-T, MDR 1028232-2008-00097.

WHEN WE HAVE RECEIVED ALL THAT CAN BE RECEIVED AND EVALUATED THE INFO, WHATEVER CONCLUSIONS OR ROOT CAUSE THAT CAN BE DISCERNED WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A FOLLOW-UP REPORT. OUR REP REPORTS THAT A PT HAD AN ARTHROSCOPIC SHOULDER REPAIR SOMETIME LATE 2007 OR EARLY 2008. SOMETIME SUBSEQUENT TO THE SURGERY, THE PT PRESENTED WITH PAIN, AND AN X-RAY DETERMINED THAT THE VERSALOK FIXATION DEVICE HAD COME OUT OF IT'S BONE HOLE AND WAS FLOATING AROUND THE PT'S JOINT SPACE. A RE-SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON A DATE UNK, THE VERSALOK WAS REMOVED AND THE SURGEON EMPLOYED SEVERAL FASTIN RCS AND A PUSHLOK BY ARTHREX AS A MEANS OF REMEDY. THIS REPAIR WAS CONCLUDED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT OR HARM TO THE PT. THE SURGEON STATED THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED 3 OTHER TIMES IN THE RECENT PAST, APPROX THE SAME SCENARIOS, DID NOT REPORT THESE AND USED BASICALLY THE SAME REMEDY. DID NOT ELABORATE ON DATES & TIMES.

APPROX 3 HRS AFTER DRINKING THE SUN-DEX, I CALLED THE DR AND TOLD HIS NURSE WHAT HAPPENED. THEY SAID, TAKE BENADRYL AND CALL BACK LATER. WHEN I WOKE UP, THE BURNING FELT WORSE, BUT THE ITCHING WASN'T BAD. I SAW THE DR. HE ALSO ADDED PROTONIX. NOTHING HELPED THE BURNING. THEN IN 1 TO 2 DAYS LATER, I CALLED THE DR BACK AND THEY PUT ME ON NEXIUM AND MAALOX, WHICH DIDN'T HELP. THE BURNING FEELING IS SLOWLY GOING AWAY.

1002790;1;THE REPORTER INDICATED THE SCREEN ON THE VNS THERAPY PROGRAMMING HANDHELD WAS FREEZING AFTER INTERROGATION AND DURING PROGRAMMING. THE REPORTER STATED, THE HANDHELD SCREEN WOULD TURN GRAY. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD AND PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS (PENDING RESULTS). DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1003068;1;"THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ACTUAL HARM TO PATIENTS. THE PRODUCT GENERATES A REPORT, WHICH IS THEN AVAILABLE: CO SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTLY NOT CLASSIFIED AS MEDICAL DEVICES. HOWEVER, ANY TIME THERE IS DATA DISCREPANCY, WITH CLINICAL CONTENT ELEMENTS BEING UNAVAILABLE TO THE END-USER, THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR HARM. IN THIS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE, DEALING SOLELY WITH THE NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY REPORT MANAGER, THE DATA ELEMENTS INVOLVED ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE SOLE DETERMINANTS FOR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING, SO THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM IS LOW. HOWEVER, IF THE SITUATION WERE TO RECUR, WITH MORE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DATA ELEMENTS BEING UNAVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL REVIEW, THE CLINICAL END-USER OF THE CO REPORT MIGHT MAKE CLINICAL DECISIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO SERIOUS INJURY. COMPLICATING THE ISSUE IS THAT THE CO REPORT IS PRESENTED IN THE CO TO A WIDE VARIETY OF USERS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT WELL VERSED IN THE FIELD OF CARDIOLOGY (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIANS). FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE ""CONCLUSIONS"" SECTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE HIS REPORT, THE FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR AN END-USER WHO IS NOT EXPERT WITH THE MORE TECHNICAL ELEMENTS OF A CARDIOLOGY STUDY. THIS COULD PROMPT A REPEAT DIAGNOSTIC STUDY, WITH ATTENDANT RISKS (E.G. ADMINISTRATION OF CONTRAST MATERIAL, CAUSING ALLERGIC REACTION OR RENAL FAILURE). AGFA IS BEING CONSERVATIVE IN REPORTING THIS PRODUCT PROBLEM. PRODUCT UTILIZES SOFTWARE, CALLED ""REPORT MANAGER FOR NUCLEAR REPORTING, OUTBOUND REPORT, VERSION 2.04.20. THIS SOFTWARE GENERATES A REPORT TO BE SENT TO THE INFORMATION SYSTEM. THIS REPORT IS REFERRED TO AS THE ""OUTBOUND"" REPORT AND IS COMMONLY RETRIEVED FROM A SITES HIS FOR USE IN PATIENT CARE. IN LATE 2007, AGFA WAS CONTACTED BY A USER THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE PRODUCT, AND PRESENT IN A SEPARATE REPORT (ALSO GENERATED BY REPORT MANAGER AND STORED ON THE PRODUCT) WAS NOT PRESENT IN THE ""OUTBOUND"" REPORT. AN EVALUATION BY AGFA PERSONNEL OF THE REQUEST FROM THIS USER FOR THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DETERMINED THAT BASED ON THE POTENTIAL USE OF THE ""OUTBOUND"" REPORT BY HOSPITAL PERSONNEL, CRITICAL AVAILABLE DATA SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE DESIGN OF THE ""OUTBOUND"" REPORT. RISK ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY AGFA PERSONNEL SUGGESTED THERE IS A POTENTIAL RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY, DUE TO POSSIBLE TREATMENT DECISIONS BECAUSE OF LACK OF KNOWN INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT. INFORMATION NOT INCLUDED IN THE ""OUTBOUND"" REPORT IS THE HEMODYNAMICS TABLE, AND THE CONCLUSIONS FROM THE NUCLEAR DATA."
1003256;0;A REVIEW OF SVC DATA DETECTED A REPORTABLE EVENT. DURING SERVICING OF ELECTRODE BELT, WHICH WAS RETURNED FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CONNECTOR PINS WERE BENT. THE LAST PT TO USE THIS ELECTRODE BELT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. DEVICE EVAL SUMMARY: DEVICE EVAL OF ELECTRODE BELT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THE ELECTRODE BELT HAD PINS THAT WERE BENT INSIDE THE CONNECTOR. THERE WERE NO PINS MISSING. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE BENT PINS WAS PROBABLY EXCESSIVE FORCE APPLIED TO THE CONNECTOR DURING MATING. THE CONNECTOR WAS FORCED INTO THE MONITOR WHICH DEFEATED THE CONNECTOR KEYING MECHANISM AND ALLOWED THE PINS TO MISALIGN WITH THE MATING SOCKETS. THE DAMAGED ELECTRODE BELT CONNECTOR WAS REPLACED. IT WAS RETESTED AND THEN RESTOCKED. NO ADVERSE EVENT RESULTED FROM THE BENT PINS. THE LAST PT TO USE THIS ELECTRODE BELT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.
1003354;0;"RESULTS EVALUATIONS: THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EVENT IS LIMITED AS THE USER FACILITY DID NOT RECORD THE CATALOG NUMBER OF THE KIT USED OR THE DEVICE LOT NUMBER. WE ARE UNABLE TO REVIEW MFG RECORDS AND TRENDING ON A PARTICULAR CATHETER. WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE RETURN OF THE SAMPLE INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT. HOWEVER, THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS USER ERROR. REVIEW OF THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE REVEALS TWO WARNINGS: NEVER PULL THE CATHETER THROUGH THE EPIDURAL TUOHY NEEDLE AS THIS CAN RESULT IN THE CATHETER BEING CUT AND LEFT IN THE EPIDURAL SPACE. IF CATHETER INSERTION DIFFICULTIES ARE ENCOUNTERED, THE EPIDURAL TUOHY NEEDLE AND CATHETER SHOULD BE REMOVED CAREFULLY TOGETHER AS A SINGLE UNIT, AND THE PROCEDURE REPEATED. DO NOT PULL THE EPIDURAL CATHETER RAPIDLY DURING REMOVAL FROM THE PT. IF RESISTANCE IS FELT ON WITHDRAWAL, CONSULT CURRENT MEDICAL LITERATURE FOR SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES. CONTINUING TO EXERT FORCE WHEN RESISTANCE IS FELT MAY LEAD TO BREAKING OF THE CATHETER."" IF THE SAMPLE IS RECEIVED, AND SHOWS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DEFECT, THEN A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED."

UPON PRESSING THE RESET BUTTON, WHICH HAS TO BE PRESSED IN ORDER TO PROCEED, AN IMAGE DISPLAYS. HOWEVER, THE IMAGE THAT APPEARS IS NOT THE CORRECT IMAGE BELONGING TO THE PATIENT, IT WAS THE PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED IMAGE FROM THE PREVIOUS PATIENT. THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM THAT MAY CAUSE PATIENTS TO RECEIVE UNNECESSARY TREATMENT, OR MAY CAUSE TREATMENT NEEDED TO BE MISSED. THE CR READER WAS PLACE OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL FURTHER TESTING RESOLVES THE ABOVE ISSUES. I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO TALK TO THE FUJI REP. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY RECENT SOFTWARE UPGRADES OR UPDATES NOR DO THEY HAVE ANY UPGRADES THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED. THE REP AND OUR IMAGING SERVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM. THERE WAS A DUPLICATE IP ADDRESS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN THERE WAS A CONFLICT, THE CONNECTION WOULD DROP OFF THE NETWORK AND MOMENTARILY LOSE CONNECTION AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE CR TO DISPLAY AN IMAGE FROM THE PREVIOUS PATIENT. IMAGING SERVICES HAS RECEIVED ANOTHER IP ADDRESS AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED.
1010171;1;INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EVENT SHOWED THAT THE USER EDITED THE SAMPLE PROGRAMMING WHICH RESULTED IN MISMATCHED SAMPLE ID AND PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS.

1012696;0;THE USER FACILITY CLAIMED THAT DURING MULTIPLE THERAPEUTIC LAPAROSCOPY PROCEDURES, LIGHT SOURCE BECAME TOO HOT, WHICH CAUSED THE IMAGE TO BECOME VERY DARK OR COMPLETELY LOST, AND HAD DAMAGED THEIR SURGICAL TELESCOPES. THE PROCEDURES WERE REPORTEDLY COMPLETED WITH A NON-OLYMPUS HEAD LAMP. THERE WERE NO PT INJURIES REPORTED. THE USER FACILITY REPORTED TO HAVE OBSERVED SIMILAR PHENOMENA IN PREVIOUS PROCEDURES, BUT ELECTED TO REUSE THE DEVICE. THE OLYMPUS LIGHT SOURCE AND A POWER CORD WAS RETURNED TO OLYMPUS FOR INVESTIGATION. THE LIGHT SOURCE WAS TESTED WITH THE RETURNED POWER CORD WHILE THE DEVICE WAS SET AT THE USER'S SETTING FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THE USER'S REPORT OF IMAGE LOSS. HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT DUPLICATE THE USER'S REPORT OF THE DEVICE OVERHEATING. THE POWER CORD THAT WAS RECEIVED WITH THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO BE PHYSICALLY CRUSHED, WHICH RESULTED IN TWO GROUND WIRES AND THE SIGNAL WIRE TO BE DAMAGED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE LIGHT SOURCE WAS RETESTED WITH A KNOWN-GOOD POWER CORD WHILE THE UNIT WAS SET FOR HIGH INTENSITY AND MAXIMUM BRIGHTNESS FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THERE WERE NO ILLUMINATION, IMAGE, OR OVERHEATING DIFFICULTIES NOTED. THE DEVICE PASSED STANDARD TESTS WITHIN THE SPECIFICATIONS. THE CAUSE OF THE USER'S EXPERIENCE WAS DETERMINED TO BE DUE TO PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE POWER CORD FROM AN UNK SOURCE.

1015084;0;"REPORT RECEIVED INDICATED THAT ONE SMART CONTROL STENT FRACTURED/SEPARATED; ONE STENT HAD INADEQUATE RADIOPACITY AND WAS INACCURATELY PLACED AND PATIENT EXPERIENCED ARTERIAL RESTENOSIS. THE PATIENT WAS ENROLLED IN THE SUPER SL STUDY. A PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY (PTA) WAS PERFORMED TO THE LEFT SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY (SFA) IN 2006. TWENTY-FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN A 100 MG/DAY OF ASPIRIN AND 600 MG/DAY OF CLOPIDOGREL. HEPARIN WAS GIVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEDURE FOR A TOTAL DOSE OF 4000IU. ACCESS METHOD WAS PERCUTANEOUS AND PUNCTURE SITE IPSILATERAL. TARGET LESION PREDILATION WAS NOT PERFORMED. THREE SMART STENTS (3X 8 X 100MM) WERE IMPLANTED IN THE LEFT PROXIMAL, MID AND DISTAL SFA. POST-DILATION WAS DONE WITH A CORDIS POWERFLEX BALLOON (5 X 80MM). THE VESSEL ANATOMY AT THE LESION SITE WAS STRAIGHT, TYPE OF LESION DE NOVO AND CALCIFIED. TOTAL LESION LENGTH WAS 180MM OF WHICH 100MM WAS OCCLUDED. THERE WAS NO THROMBUS PRESENT AT THE SITE BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. THE REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 6MM. THE PERCENTAGE STENOSIS BEFORE PROCEDURE WAS 90% AND AFTER STENT PLACEMENT AND POST-DILATION 0%. THERE WAS NO VESSEL DISSECTION. DURING PLACEMENT OF SECOND STENT, THE PROXIMAL AND DISTAL STENT MARKERS WERE NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED SO THAT THE SECOND STENT WAS COMPLETELY PLACED INTO THE FIRST STENT; THIS MADE PLACEMENT OF A THIRD STENT NECESSARY. PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED IN 2006. MEDICATION AT DISCHARGE: ASPIRIN CLOPIDOGREL. A 12 MONTH FOLLOW UP WAS MADE IN 2007 WHERE ONE STENT FOUND FRACTURED/SEPARATED 3CM FROM THE PROXIMAL END WITH BINARY RESTENOSIS IN THE PROXIMAL EDGE AND OCCLUSION FOR WHICH ATHERECTOMY WAS PERFORMED ON A WEEK LATER, IS NOT KNOWN WHICH ONE OF THE THREE STENTS IMPLANTED HAS THE REPORTED FRACTURE/SEPARATION. IT IS ALSO NOT KNOWN WHICH OF THE STENTS HAD THE INADEQUATE RADIOPACITY AND WAS INACCURATELY PLACED AT THE LESION SITE. THEREFORE, ALL THREE STENTS ARE BEING REPORTED ACCORDINGLY. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING AS IS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE SENT WITHIN 30 DAYS UPON RECEIPT. THIS IS ONE OF THREE PRODUCTS INVOLVED IN THE SAME PATIENT AND REPORTED UNDER MANUFACTURING NUMBERS 9616099-2008-00651, 9616099-2008-00652 AND 9616099-2008-00654."
1015415;1;MARCH 17, 2008: THE RETURN OF THE DEVICE IS PENDING. THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE LG, THERE WAS AN INACCURACY ISSUE DURING THE NAVIGATION PROCESS. ON THE CROSS SECTIONS OF THE NAVIGATION SCREENS, THE TIP OF THE LG WAS OFF, ABOUT 12CM, WHEN THE ACTUAL VIDEO IMAGE SHOWED THE LG TIP PHYSICALLY TOUCHING THE MAIN CARINA. A NEW LG WAS THEN USED AND THE CASE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITH NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.
1015505;0;"THE CUSTOMER STATED THEY WERE EXPERIENCING HIGH WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) BACKGROUNDS ON THE CELL-DYN 4000 HEMATOLOGY ANALYZER DUE TO THE WBC REAGENT A. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. EVALUATION: OTHER, MICROBIAL TESTING OF OPENED/UNOPENED REAGENTS AND RETENTION LOTS. OTHER, WBC REAGENT PART A (LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2). THE CELL-DYN 4000 AND CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZERS WERE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED WBC BACKGROUND COUNTS IN THE FIELD. BACKGROUND COUNTS WERE RECOVERING UP TO 0.5 X 103/UL .THE SPECIFICATION FOR WBC BACKGROUND READINGS IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.10X103/UL PER THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE OPERATOR'S MANUAL, AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL. BACKGROUNDS COUNTS MUST BE WITHIN SPECIFICATION PRIOR TO REPORTING OF PATIENT SAMPLES. IF THE OPERATOR PROCEEDS TO RUN PATIENT SAMPLES WITH BACKGROUND COUNTS OUT OF SPECIFICATION, RESULTS MAY EXHIBIT FLUORESCENT PARTICLE FLAGGING, FLUORESCENT CHANNEL 3 FLAGS, RESISTANT RBC FLAGS, INCREASED NUCLEATED RBC FLAGS OR ABNORMAL WBC HISTOGRAM SCATTER PLOTS. IF PRODUCT LABELING IS NOT FOLLOWED AND PATIENT RESULTS ARE REPORTED, WBC RESULTS MAY BE INACCURATE AND HIGHER THAN ACTUAL RESULTS; HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PATIENT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE DETECTED MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION IN THE WBC REAGENT PART A WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED FOR USE WITH THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS IDENTIFIED ONLY ON LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2 OF WBC REAGENT PART A. THE CONTAMINANT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO BE PSEUDOMONAS SPECIES, AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATE COMMON IN BIO-FILMS, AND DOES NOT PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION, SPORADIC IN NATURE, CAN AFFECT OTHER LOTS OF WBC REAGENT PART A, AS MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WITHIN THE WBC REAGENT PART A CAN FURTHER CONTAMINATE THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEMS. THE SOURCE OF THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF FILTRATION OF WATER USED FOR CLEANING PROCEDURES, BIOFILM SHEDDING IN THE FILL LINE, INCREASED BIOBURDEN DUE TO STAGNANT ZONES IN THE FILL-LINE AREA AND FAILURE TO ACCURATELY DETECT CONTAMINATION AS PART OF PRODUCT RELEASE. THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION: - ALL THREE AFFECTED LOTS WERE RECALLED FROM THE FIELD AND CUSTOMERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO DECONTAMINATE THEIR INSTRUMENTS PRIOR TO USING ANY NEW WBC REAGENT PART A. - INCORPORATION OF AN IMPROVED MICROBIAL TESTING METHOD INTO THE CURRENT PROCESS. - INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SANITIZATION IN THE FILL-LINE AREA, INCLUDING FILTRATION OF THE WATER USED FOR CLEANING-IN-PLACE PROCEDURES. - INCREASED FLUSHING OF THE FILL-LINE EQUIPMENT AND AUTOCLAVING OF FILL-LINE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS NOZZLES. COMPLETION OF THE FINAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE END OF 4TH QUARTER 2008. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ONLY IN WBC PART A REAGENT, FOR LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2 AND 56675I2; HOWEVER, IF THE INSTRUMENT IS NOT PROPERLY DECONTAMINATED, THE CONTAMINATED WBC REAGENT PART A HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS AND CAN THEN BACK-CONTAMINATE OTHER BOTTLES OF WBC REAGENT PART A PLACED ON THE CONTAMINATED INSTRUMENT. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE."
1015576;1;THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE LG THERE WAS AN INACCURACY ISSUE OF 1.1 CM DURING THE NAVIGATION.

THE THERAPEUTIC CONSULTANT STATED THE REPORTER WANTED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR THE SITE. THE MFR HAS RECEIVED THE HANDHELD/SOFTWARE AND PROGRAMMING WAND FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. NO ANOMALY WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE WAND THAT WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT DEVICE PERFORMANCE. THEREFORE, NO CONDITION WAS FOUND WITH THE WAND THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE HANDHELD AND NO ANOMALIES THAT SUPPORT THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WERE IDENTIFIED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE FLASHCARD AND NO ANOMALIES THAT SUPPORT THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WERE IDENTIFIED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.
1018179;1;THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT AFTER SHE CHANGED THE PROGRAM SETTINGS AND INTERROGATION, A SQL ERROR MESSAGE DISPLAYED ON HER HANDHELD. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE EVENT. THE THERAPEUTIC CONSULTANT WAS SENT TO THE SITE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE MANUFACTURING REPRESENTATIVE ISOLATED THE PROBLEM TO THE OLD HANDHELD. THE MANUFACTURER HAS RECEIVED THE HANDHELD/ SOFTWARE FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS (PENDING RESULTS) DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1018182;1;REPORTER INDICATED THE PHYSICIAN'S HAND-HELD IS CONSISTENTLY READS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED EVEN THOUGH THEY CHARGE IT OVER NIGHT. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1018192;1;RPTR INDICATED THAT A DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER'S SCREEN WAS FREEZING DURING AND AFTER INTERROGATION. RESEATING THE FLASH CARD SOMETIMES RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE PROD HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS.
1018194;1;RPTR INDICATED THAT A DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER'S SCREEN WAS FREEZING DURING AND AFTER INTERROGATION. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD SOMETIMES RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE PROD HAS BEEN RETURNED TO MFR FOR ANALYSIS.
1018195;1;RPTR INDICATED THAT A DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER'S PERFORMANCE WAS DELAYED AFTER INTERROGATION. ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH PROGRAMMING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. ANOTHER COMPUTER WAS USED TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND PROGRAMMING. THE PROD WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS. A NEW DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN AND IS REPORTED TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
1018200;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A DELL HANDHELD WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. WHEN A SOFT RESET WAS PERFORMED THE PROBLEM WOULD RESOLVE.

1018323;0;PRODUCT ANALYSIS COULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THE CROSSING DIFFICULTY AS STATED IN THE COMPLAINT. PRODUCT ANALYSIS DID REVEAL STENT DAMAGE. THE DELIVERY DEVICE WITH THE STENT ON THE BALLOON WAS RECEIVED AND DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE STENT. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE STENT REVEALED DAMAGE TO THE PROXIMAL END. THE PROXIMAL STENT STRUTS WERE BENT. THE STENT HAD ALSO MOVED DISTALLY ON THE BALLOON APPROXIMATELY 3 MILLIMETERS. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE MATERIAL SURROUNDING THE DAMAGED STRUTS DID NOT REVEAL ANY INHERENT MATERIAL DEFICIENCIES THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DAMAGE. THE BALLOON WAS VISUALLY AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED. NO VISUAL DEFECTS WERE OBSERVED UNDER MAGNIFICATION. THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY WRAPPED AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANY POSITIVE PRESSURE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE DEVICE WAS IMPROPERLY MANUFACTURED. FINAL SDS INSPECTION INCLUDES A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE BALLOON, AND STENT LOCATION AND APPEARANCE. DAMAGE OF THIS NATURE IS USUALLY THE RESULT OF THE CATHETER BEING SUBJECTED TO SOME POSITIVE PRESSURE PRIOR TO THE STENT DEPLOYMENT. A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF ALL THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IS INSUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE AN EXACT ROOT CAUSE. THEREFORE, THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE WILL BE CONSIDERED OPERATIONAL CONTEXT DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANATOMICAL AND OR PROCEDURAL FACTORS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PROCEDURE WHICH LIMITED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE. THE SHOP FLOOR PAPERWORK HAS BEEN REVIEWED AND NO ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RELATE TO THIS COMPLAINT. THE SHOP FLOOR PAPERWORK REVIEW CONFIRMS THAT THIS DEVICE MET MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE SPECS. A CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THIS COMPLAINT IS NOW REPORTABLE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS COMPLETED 02/22/2008. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING PROCEDURE, THE STENT COULD NOT CROSS THE LESION. NO COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED, HOWEVER, THE RETURNED PRODUCT CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS STENT DAMAGE. THE PATIENT PRESENTED TO THE INDEX PROCEDURE FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. THE TARGET LESION WAS THE MID CIRCUMFLEX. THE LESION WAS 4.5 MM WIDE, 20 MM LONG, AND WITH 80% STENOSIS. THIS WAS A LONG LESION AND PRIOR BRACHYTHERAPY HAD BEEN PERFORMED. THERE WAS A 90 DEGREE BEND IN THE LESION. THE PHYSICIAN PREDILATED THE LESION PRIOR TO STENTING. THE PHYSICIAN THEN IMPLANTED A 5.0 X 12 MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DISTALLY. THEN THE PHYSICIAN PLANNED TO IMPLANT A 4.5 X 16 MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 STENT PROXIMALLY. HOWEVER, THE STENT COULDN'T BE DELIVERED TO THE TARGET LESION. SO THE PHYSICIAN USED 4.0 X 8 MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 AND COMPLETED THE PROCEDURE SUCCESSFULLY. PATIENT CONDITION WAS STABLE. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX.
1018388;1;THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED UPON NOTIFICATION FOR OUR X-RAY MANUFACTURER IN BEST, NETHERLANDS OF AN EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. THIS IS AN X-RAY SYSTEM. WHEN THE USER INITIATED A SCANNING COMMAND, THE TABLE PERFORMED A SPONTANEOUS TILTING MOVEMENT. THIS SPONTANEOUS TABLE TILTING MOVEMENT STOPPED IMMEDIATELY AFTER RELEASING THE SCANNING COMMAND. NO PATIENT WAS INJURED. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ROOT CAUSE, BESIDES TABLE TILT MOVEMENTS, OTHER SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTS, LIKE TABLE LONGITUDINAL, TRANSVERSAL AND HEIGHT AS WELL AS SID MOVEMENTS MAY OCCUR. CONCLUSIONS (OTHER) - INVESTIGATION FOUND TWO CAUSES OF THIS PROBLEM. ONE IS DUE TO A SINGLE PATIENT OVERLOAD OF STORED DATABASE IMAGES AND SECOND CAUSE IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE. THESE TWO ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IN MANDATORY FIELD CHANGE ORDER.
1018561;0;"RESULTS EVALUATIONS: INVESTIGATION: THE RETURNED UNIT WAS FUNCTIONALLY TESTED AND THE REPORT OF LEAKAGE WAS CONFIRMED. AIR LEAKAGE WAS OBSERVED FROM THE ONE WAY VALVE. EXAMINATION OF THE VALVE REVEALED A WHITE POWDERY SUBSTANCE WITHIN THE INFLATION LINE AND PILOT BALLOON. THE LEAKAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE WHITE POWDER BEING LODGED BENEATH THE VALVE SEAL, PREVENTING CLOSURE. FLUSHING OF THE ONE WAY VALVE WITH DISTILLED WATER REMOVED THE CONTAMINATION AND ENABLED THE VALVE SEAL TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINTS HISTORY DATABASE HIGHLIGHTED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE FOR THE TWO POSSIBLE LOTS IDENTIFIED. THE SEARCH ALSO REVEALED THIS TO BE THE FIRM COMPLAINT OF THIS NATURE FOR THIS PRODUCT CODE. ""A TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION REVIEW WAS CARRIED OUT WHICH RAISED NO ANOMALIES AND CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A VISUAL INSPECTION DURING PACKAGING ON 100% OF THIS PRODUCT LINE. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS WE FIND THIS COMPLAINT DOES NOT RELATE TO MFG ERROR AND WILL BE CLOSED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION. THIS REPORT HAS BEEN LOGGED FOR TRENDING."

AN INTERNAL CLINICAL REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY INADEQUATE SEAL BETWEEN THE MAIN BODY AND LEG GRAFTS AND/OR INADEQUATE OVERLAP BETWEEN MAIN BODY AND LEG GRAFTS.
1019868;0;DURING THE REVISION SURGERY, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE MARGRON STEM WAS WELL FIXED. THE 'CLICKING' SOUND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN INCORRECT OFFSET BEING CHOSEN BY THE SURGEON WHO DID THE PRIMARY IMPLANT SURGERY WHICH CAUSED IMPINGEMENT OF THE NECK ON THE CUP OR LINER OF THE HIP REPLACEMENT. ALSO AN INCORRECT NECK SIZE WAS CHOSEN BY THE SURGEON AND THERE WAS POOR TISSUE BALANCE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PAIN THE PT EXPERIENCED. THE PRIMARY MARGRON IMPLANT WAS REVISED WITH ANOTHER MFR'S HIP REPLACEMENT SYSTEM. THE EVENT IS BEING REPORTED FOLLOWING A REASSESSMENT BY PORTLAND ORTHOPAEDICS. THE REASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER A TREND REGARDING EARLY REVISION RATES WITH THE MARGRON DEVICE WAS OBSERVED BY ANOTHER COUNTRY ORTHOPAEDIC ASSOCIATION IN ITS 2007 ANOTHER COUNTRY NATIONAL JOINT REGISTRY REPORT. THIS OBSERVED TREND AND PORTLAND'S INITIAL ANALYSIS WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO FDA IN MDR NO. 9613642-2008-00001. AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, PORTLAND HAS TAKEN THE MARGRON DTC SYSTEM OFF THE MARKET IN THE U.S. PENDING FURTHER EVAL OF THE DEVICE AND EVENTS, EXCEPT FOR CASES IN WHICH MARGRON-SPECIFIC TOOLS OR COMPONENTS ARE NECESSARY TO PERFORM REVISION OF A MARGRON IMPLANT. PT REPORTED PAIN AND 'CLICKING' SOUNDS POSTOPERATIVELY FROM A PRIMARY MARGRON-DTC HIP REPLACEMENT. PROBLEMS APPEARED TO BE DUE TO SURGEON ERROR IN PRIMARY HIP AND REPLACEMENT SURGERY. REVISION SURGERY WAS PERFORMED WITH AN ALTERNATE MFR'S HIP REPLACEMENT SYSTEM.

1022303;1;PRELIMINARY INFO ON THE PROBLEM: THE SYSTEM PERFORMS QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) CHECKING TO DETECT PROBLEMS AND TO DISPLAY WARNINGS AND FAILURES THAT ALERT A TECHNOLOGIST TO PROBLEMS, SUCH AS ABO/RH INCOMPATIBILITIES. WHILE PERFORMING IN-HOUSE TESTING, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE QUALITY ASSURANCE WARNINGS AND FAILURES ASSOCIATED WITH ABO/RH CHECKING ARE NOT GENERATED FOR SOURCE UNITS IN THE ATYPICAL WORKFLOW WHERE A POOLED UNIT IS POOLED WITH ANOTHER UNIT. FOR EXAMPLE, UNITS ARE POOLED TO CREATE UNIT(THIRD) IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THAT UNIT(FOURTH) WAS MISTAKENLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPONENT PREPARATION WITHIN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM WHEN UNIT(THIRD) WAS CREATED. TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, UNIT(THIRD) IS POOLED WITH UNIT PLT789 TO CREATE UNIT(FIFTH) IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE WARNINGS/FAILURES ARE EVALUATED CORRECTLY FOR THE SOURCE UNITS, BUT NOT FOR THIS UNITS(FIRST AND SECOND) THAT ARE SOURCE (THIRD)UNITS THE SCENARIO WAS FOUND DURING IN HOUSE TESTING BY QUALITY CONTROL STAFF AT SUNQUEST INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WHILE PERFORMING IN-HOUSE TESTING, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE FOLLOWING QUALITY ASSURANCE WARNINGS/FAILURES ARE NOT GENERATED FOR SOURCE UNITS IN THE ATYPICAL WORKFLOW WHERE A POOLED UNIT IS POOLED WITH ANOTHER UNIT: SELECTED UNIT'S ABO DOES NOT MATCH PT'S PERMANENT ABO(SEE ATTACHED TABLE: TYPE 70 ). SELECTED UNIT'S RH DOES NOT MATCH PT'S PERMANENT RH (SEE ATTACHED TABLE : TYPE 71), SELECTED UNIT'S ABO DOES NOT MATCH SPECIMEN'S ABO. (SEE ATTACHED TABLE:TYPE 72) SLECTED UNIT'S RH DOES NOT MATCH SPECIMEN'S RH (SEE ATTACHED TABLE :TYPE 73) SPECIMEN TESTING ABO DOES MATCH ALLOCATED UNIT'S ABO (SEE ATTACHED TABLE:TYPE 80). SPECIMEN TESTING RH DOES NOT MATCH ALLOCATED UNIT'S RH (SEE ATTACHED TABLE 81). PRIOR TO USING THE SUNQUEST BLOOD BANK APPLICATION, THE TECH HAS POOLED THREE UNITS. WHEN THE TECH DOCUMENTS THE POOLED UNITS USING THE FUNCTION BLOOD COMPONENT PREPARATION (BCP), THE TECH NEGLECTS TO INCLUDE THE THIRD UNIT IN THE POOL. TO CORRECT THE UNIT HISTORY, THE TECH, USING AN ATYPICAL WORKFLOW, POOLS THE THIRD UNIT WITH THE ORIGINAL POOL, CREATING A NEW POOL.

INVESTIGATION INTO THIS EVENT DETERMINED THAT THE CUSTOMER REUSED SAMPLE IDS THAT HAD PENDING RESULTS STORED IN THE ANALYZER. IF A SAMPLE IS NOT PROCESSED TO COMPLETION, THE SAMPLE PROGRAMMING AND ASSOCIATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ARE RETAINED BY THE ANALYZER IN A ""PENDING"" STATE. REUSING THE SAMPLE ID ON A DIFFERENT SAMPLE WITHOUT COMPLETION OF THE ORIGINAL REQUEST WILL CAUSE THE ORIGINAL INFORMATION TO BE CARRIED FORWARD. USER ERROR IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT."
1022459;0;"THERE IS A COMPONENT ON THE COVER OF THE CARTRIDGE CALLED THE SNAP CLOSURE. THE SNAP CLOSURE CREATES AN AIRTIGHT SEAL NECESSARY FOR PROPER FLUID MOVEMENT WITHIN THE CARTRIDGE. THE CLOSURE ENSURES THE CALIBRANT AND SAMPLE REMAIN CONTAINED WITHIN THE CARTRIDGE DURING THE TESTING CYCLE AND SUBSEQUENT DISPOSAL. THE USER IS INSTRUCTED TO FOLD THE SNAP CLOSURE OVER THE SAMPLE WELL AND TO PRESS THE ROUNDED END OF THE CLOSURE UNTIL IT SNAPS INTO PLACE AFTER A LOADING SAMPLE. THE SNAP CLOSURE REMAINS IN PLACE BY A LATCH HOOK. IN THE CASE OF THIS PRODUCT ISSUE, THE SNAP CLOSURE WAS HARD TO CLOSE AND/OR DID NOT REMAIN CLOSED. AN INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED AN ASSIGNABLE CAUSE FOR THE ISSUE; A NON-OPTIMAL DIMENSION OF THE SNAP CLOSURE MECHANISM. IT WAS FOUND THAT WHEN THE DIMENSION OF THE LATCH HOOK IS CLOSER TO THE LOWER END OF THE SPECIFICATION MORE FORCE IS REQUIRED TO ENGAGE THE HOOK WITH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE COVER THAN WHEN IT IS TOWARD THE UPPER END OF THE SPECIFICATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROBABILITY IS HIGHER THAT A FORCE IS GENERATED UPON CLOSURE OF THE LATCH THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO DEFORM THE PLASTIC WHERE THE HOOK MUST ENGAGE WITH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE COVER. ONCE THE PLASTIC IS DEFORMED, THE SNAP CLOSURE CANNOT CLOSE OR WILL NOT REMAIN CLOSED. A CUSTOMER STATED THE SNAP CLOSURE ON AN I-STAT 6+ CARTRIDGE IS DIFFICULT TO CLOSE. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLAINT."
1022490;0;OUR REP IS REPORTING THAT DURING AN ARTHROSCOPIC SHOULDER PROCEDURE, THE SURGEON OBSERVED METAL SHAVINGS EMANATING FROM 2 SEPARATE LUPINE DRILL GUIDES FALLING INTO THE PATIENT'S JOINT SPACE. ALL OF THE DEBRIS WAS REMOVED FROM THE BODY AND THE PROCEDURE WAS CONCLUDED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT OR HARM TO THE PATIENT. ALSO SEE ASSOCIATED MDR 1221934-2008-00158. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF EVENT IS MOST LIKELY TECHNIQUE RELATED, EXTENSIVE LAB TESTING HAS SHOWN THAT UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, THE REPORTED EVENT MODE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED, HOWEVER, UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS, THAT IS WHEN THE DRILL GUIDE WAS BENT DURING DRILLING WITH A DRILL BIT, THIS CAUSED THE DRILL BIT TO RUB AGAINST INNER SURFACE OF THE BENT DRILL GUIDE CAUSING SOME METAL TO SHAVE OFF OF THE DRILL GUIDE, THE REPORTED CONDITION WAS THEN DUPLICATED. THIS PHENOMENA HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A LONG AND CONSIDERABLE STUDY. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, THE ENGINEERING DESIGN AND THE QUALITY ENGINEERING TEAMS ARE IN THE MIDST OF DEVELOPING SOME DESIGN CHANGES TO SUBVERT AND OR GREATLY REDUCE THIS TYPE OF EVENT. MITEK WILL CONTINUE TO TRACT ANY RELATED COMPLAINTS WITHIN THIS DEVICE FAMILY AS A MEANS OF MONITORING THE EXTENT WITH WHICH THIS COMPLAINT IS OBSERVED IN THE FIELD. WHEN AND IF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE IS RECEIVED HERE AT MITEK, IT WILL BE DISCARDED AS THE REPORTED PHENOMENON IS ACKNOWLEDGED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ADDRESSED.

NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME.
1026172;1;WHEN REVIEWING RESULTS GENERATED BY THE ARCHITECT C8000 ANALYZER, THE CUSTOMER FOUND ONE SAMPLE ID THAT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TWO DIFFERENT NAMES AND SET OF RESULTS. THE ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED PRIOR TO RELEASE OF RESULTS FROM THE LABORATORY. THE DATA REVEALED THAT THE CORRECT BARCODE SCANNED FOR THE FIRST SAMPLE, BUT THE HOST RESPONDED WITH THE NAME AND TEST PROFILE FOR THE SECOND SAMPLE. THE SAMPLES WERE RERUN, CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED, AND ANALYZED APPROPRIATELY. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED. AN INVESTIGATION PERFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER'S HOST LIS VENDOR OMNILAB DETERMINED THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY A KNOWN ISSUE WITH AN OLDER DLL DRIVER VERSION IN THE AMS-LABONLINE MIDDLEWARE THAT PROVIDED THE WRONG PATIENT NAME AND TEST ORDER IN RESPONSE TO THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM'S SID HOST QUERY. THE NEWEST VERSION OF THE DLL DRIVER WAS INSTALLED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS AND TRENDING INFORMATION DID NOT IDENTIFY AN ADVERSE TREND. A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL FOUND SUFFICIENT LABELING WITH REGARD TO SYSTEM CONFIGURATION, SAMPLE ORDERING, CONFIGURING HOST INTERFACE SETTINGS, HOST ORDER QUERY, CONFIGURING REPORTS, AND SYSTEM LIMITATIONS. THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CUSTOMER'S LIS HOST SOFTWARE PROVIDED AN INCORRECT PATIENT NAME AND TEST ORDER IN RESPONSE TO THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM'S SID HOST QUERY. THE ARCHITECT SOFTWARE IS FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED. A DEFICIENCY OF THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT.

THIS PATIENT WAS UNDERGOING COIL EMBOLIZATION WITHIN THE ANTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY ANEURYSM, WHICH MEASURED (DOME, SAC, NECK SIZE WERE 3.6MM, 4.1MM, 3.8MM). PRIOR TO USE, THE COIL WAS NOTED TO BE STRETCHED WHEN THE PHYSICIAN CHECKED IT IN THE SALINE. THE SECOND COIL WAS ADVANCED THROUGH THE PROWLER 14 MICROCATHETER (MC), BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THE SHAPE OF THE COIL. HE THEN MANIPULATED THE COIL IN THE ANEURYSM SAC SEVERAL TIMES, AND HE FOUND THAT THE COIL WAS STRETCHED. THERE WAS SOME TORTUOUSITY. THE PHYSICIAN FELT RESISTANCE WHILE ADVANCING THE COIL THROUGH THE Y-CONNECTOR. (THE Y-CONNECTOR WAS BEING SECONDARY USED). IT APPEARS THE PHYSICIAN WAS TRYING TO MAKE BETTER SHAPE WHEN THE COIL STRETCHED. THERE WAS A ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COIL AND DELIVERY TUBE AND WAS VERIFIED WITH FLUORO PRIOR TO REPOSITIONING. THE STRETCHED COIL REMOVED FROM THE MC WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND TRIED NOT TO PULL OUT ALL THE SYSTEM. THE PROCEDURE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. CONTINUOUS FLUSHING WAS MAINTAINED; HE FOLLOWED THE IFU EXACTLY, EXCEPT HE CHECKED THE COIL IN THE SALINE. EVERY TIME THE PHYSICIAN USES COIL DURING THE PROCEDURE, HE CHECKS THE COIL IN THE SALINE BECAUSE HE IS WORRIED ABOUT EARLY DETACHMENT. AN ENVOY 6F MPD 100CM AND AN AGILITY 14 AND SYNCHRO 14 WERE USED. ALSO, MC USED WAS PROWLER 14 X 90, EXCELSIOR 10 X 45. (HE PERFORMED DOUBLE CATHETER TECHNIQUE.)"

1033477;1;"IN 2008, AFTER ACQUIRING 6 SEQUENCES DURING A CARDIAC PROCEDURE, AN ERROR MESSAGE WAS DISPLAYED THAT WAS THE RESULT OF A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION CAUSING WINDOWS TO RESTART. AFTER WINDOWS RESTARTED, THUMBNAIL IMAGES WERE PRESENT, BUT NO ACQUIRED IMAGES WERE AVAILABLE. AFTER A SECOND REBOOT, NO THUMBNAIL IMAGES WERE PRESENT EITHER. THE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO VIEW ANY IMAGES. SINCE THIS PROCEDURE WAS REQUIRED IN PREPARATION FOR SURGERY, THE IMAGES WERE ACQUIRED AGAIN (RE-EXPOSING THE PATIENT TO X-RAY) BEFORE ANY SYSTEM EVALUATION. THESE NEW IMAGES WERE REVIEWED AND THE EVALUATION WAS COMPLETED. THE X-RAY TECHNICIAN REPORTED THE MALFUNCTION TO INFIMED AFTER NOTICING THAT THE 2 NEW RUN SEQUENCES SEEMED TO BE INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED AS THE FIRST 2 RUNS. THE SYSTEM PERFORM AS EXPECTED FOR 2 MORE DAYS WHILE UNDER EVALUATION BY THE SITE X-RAY TECHNICIAN. AN INFIMED TECHNICAL SUPPORT ENGINEER ARRIVED AT THE SITE TWO DAYS LATER TO INSTALL A REPLACEMENT TOWER AND RETURN THE ORIGINAL TOWER TO INFIMED. THE INFIMED ENGINEER REMAINED ON SITE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONTH TO OBSERVE ALL CASES DURING THAT PERIOD. NO ISSUES WERE NOTED. THE ORIGINAL TOWER WAS RECEIVED ON 4/02/2008 AT INFIMED FOR EVALUATION AND HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY REMOVED FROM SERVICE. INFIMED ENGINEERING WAS NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE FAILURE DURING EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED SYSTEM TOWER. HOWEVER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ""LOST"" IMAGES WERE STILL ON THE SYSTEM RAID DRIVE IN A RECOVERABLE STATE. THESE IMAGES WERE EXPORTED TO DICOM MEDIA AND THEN RETURNED TO KAISER FONTANA. THE LOG FILES OF BOTH THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND THE P1 CARDIAC SOFTWARE WERE COLLECTED AND REVIEWED. THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ANY INDICATION OF WHY THE SYSTEM PRODUCED THE ERROR OTHER THAN THE 'CRASH.LOG' RECORDED AN EVENT AT THE APPROXIMATE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, THE CORRESPONDING SOURCE CODE OF THE P1 CARDIAC WAS THOROUGHLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY CONFLICTS THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE ERROR. NONE WERE FOUND. A POSSIBLE CAUSE MAY HAVE BEEN MEMORY CORRUPTION THAT WAS MANIFESTED AND EVENTUALLY COULD NOT BE HANDLED ANY LONGER BY THE SYSTEM."
1034306;0;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THE PATIENT WAS EXPERIENCING TROUBLE SLEEPING AND HAVING INCREASED SEIZURES. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE REPORT OF INCREASED SEIZURES WAS ABOVE OR BELOW THE PATIENT'S PRE VNS SEIZURE RATE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SURROUNDING THE EVENT. NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE SITE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PATIENT HAD HIS DEVICE DISABLED DUE TO STRANGE SIDE EFFECTS. THE PATIENT HAD PREVIOUSLY REPORTED EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN SEIZURES AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PATIENT WAS REFERRING TO THESE EVENTS WHEN DISCUSSING HIS SIDE EFFECTS. PROGRAMMING HISTORY WAS REVIEWED FOR THE PATIENT AND REVEALED THAT THE PATIENT'S DEVICE WAS PROGRAMMED OFF AROUND THE TIME OF THE REPORTED SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND INCREASED SEIZURES. NO FURTHER INTERVENTION REGARDING THE SLEEP DISTURBANCES OR INCREASED SEIZURES WAS REPORTED.

1034466;0;"NO PATIENT CONSEQUENCES WERE REPORTED. ONE USED CATHETER WAS RECEIVED ON 04/11/2008. THE UNIT WAS VISUALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY EXAMINED. RESULTS OF THE TESTING ARE AS FOLLOWS: VISUAL INSPECTION FOUND CATHETER SHAFT DAMGE AT THE DISTAL FUSE AREA 9.2 CM FROM THE DISTAL TIP. THE CATHETER WAS HELD TOGETHER BY THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS AS DESIGNED. CATHETERS FROM THE SAME LOT WERE PULLED FROM FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY AND WORST CASE CONDITIONS WERE SIMULATED. THE CATHETERS WERE PRECONDITIONED FOR 4 HOURS IN A HEATED 37 DEGREE CELSIUS WATER BATH (BODY TEMPERATURE), SUBJECTED TO REPETITIVE CYCLES OF FLEXION/DEFLECTION (40 CYCLES STEERING) FOLLOWED BY 720 DEGREES TWISTING FORCE (TORQUE) BASED ON THE SAME ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED DURING PRODUCT DESIGN. WITH EACH ROTATION, THE FUSE AREA WAS EXAMINED UNDER A MICROSCOPE. EVIDENCE OF STRESS BUILDUP WAS OBSERVED DURING THE SIMULATION TESTING, HOWEVER, ALL FOUR CATHETERS RETAINED MECHANICAL INTEGRITY AT GREATER THAN 2X THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. THE TEST WAS CONTINUED TO FAILURE. THE FAILURE MODE WAS ONLY DUPLICATED AFTER 4 FULL ROTATIONS IN THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH IS BEYOND NORMAL USE. THE FUSING PROCESS IS CLOSELY MONITORED. PROCESS MONITORING DATA WAS REVIEWED FOR THE PERIOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THIS LOT WAS WELL AS A 6 MONTHS PERIOD AND EXCEEDS MINIMUM TENSILE STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS OF 3.37 LBS. IN ALL CASES, THE CATHETER SHAFT STRETCHED BEFORE A FUSE JOINT FAILURE OCCURRED, INDICATING A STRONG FUSE JOINT. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR LOT 61557 WAS ALSO REVIEWED TO ENSURE ALL MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED AND REPORTED AS COMPLETE AND ACCEPTABLE. NO EVIDENCE OF A MANUFACTURING ERROR COULD BE FOUND. IN 2007 AND 2008 COMPLAINTS WERE REVIEWED. THIS IS A RARE OCCURRENCE. THE TEST DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE CATHETER WAS OVER-TORQUED BEYOND NORMAL USE. SINCE LOAD OR TENSION MUST BE PLACED ONTO THE CATHETER, THE DISTAL SECTION MAY HAVE BEEN ENTRAPPED IN A POCKET OF TISSUE. THE FUSING PROCESS AND TUBING TENSILE STRENGTH HAVE BEEN VALIDATED TO ENSURE MECHANICAL INTEGRITY UNDER NORMAL USE CONDITIONS. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE STATE ""EXCESSIVE BENDING OR KINKING OF THE CATHETER MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CATHETER."" DURING AN AF ABLATION, THE CATHETER WAS NOT RESPONDING TO TORQUE ON THE CATHETER. THE CATHETER WAS REMOVED AND DAMAGE TO THE DISTAL SECTION OF THE CATHETER SHAFT WAS OBSERVED. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE PATIENT."

1035459;1;TESTING ON AN IN-HOUSE ECHO INSTRUMENT WAS  PERFORMED  FOLLOWING THE SCENARIO THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPLAINT.  WHEN PIPETTING FAILURE OCCURS ALONG WITH  THE FAILED  COLOR CHECK READ FOR ANTI-B REAGENT, THERE IS A  FAILURE TO DETECT THE ABSENCE OF ANTI-B  REAGENT. THIS CAN LEAD TO GROUP B OR AB BEING MISTYPED AS O  OR A, RESPECTIVELY IN THE DONOR, CONFIRM AND PEDIATRIC ASSAYS. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE PIPETTING FAILURE  IS SOFTWARE RELATED AND WILL BE CORRECTED WITH A SOFTWARE PATCH. CUSTOMERS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM IN 2008.  INVESTIGATION  INTO THE  ANTI-B COLOR CHECK ISSUE IS ONGOING. THE OPERATOR MANUAL INDICATES THAT  FORWARD ONLY ABO-RH TESTING HAS A HIGHER RISK OF MISTYPE DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE REVERSE TYPE RESULTS.  HAZARDOUS MISTYPES MAY OCCUR, SUCH AS AN A SAMPLE BEING INTERPRETED AS A GROUP AB, OR AN RH (D) NEGATIVE SAMPLE BEING INTERPRETED AS RH(D) POSITIVE. FOR THIS REASON, ABO-RH RESULTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE COMPARED TO THE PATIENT OR DONOR'S HISTORY. BEFORE RED BLOOD CELL PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED FOR TRANSFUSION, ABO AND RH (D) TEST RESULTS SHOULD BE VERIFIED.  THIS VERIFICATION CAN CONSIST OF AN IMMEDIATE SPIN CROSSMATCH OR A RESULT COMPARISON TO A SECOND CURRENT OR HISTORICAL ABO AND RH (D) TEST BY THE SAME OR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD.  THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL ABO-RH ASSAYS, BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT A REVERSE TEST. CUSTOMER REPORTED ABO MISTYPE ON DONOR SAMPLES. DURING A DONOR RECHECK ASSAY  ON THE ECHO, THEY RECEIVED A REAGENT VERIFICATION ERROR WITH THE ANTI-B REAGENT. REVIEW OF THE COLOR CHECK IMAGES FOR THE SAMPLES INDICATED ALL OF THE ANTI-B WELLS WERE EMPTY. ADDITIONALLY,  THE COLOR CHECK FAILED FOR TWO OF THE FIVE  DONOR SAMPLES.  THE THREE SAMPLES THAT PASSED THE COLOR CHECK REPORTED RESULTS, HOWEVER.  BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ANTI-B PIPETTED INTO THE WELLS, THESE 3 SAMPLES SHOULD HAVE FAILED THE COLOR CHECK AS WELL.
1035570;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A DELL HANDHELD COMPUTER'S SCREEN WOULD NOT POWER ON. CHARGING THE HANDHELD'S BATTERY DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCT FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1035710;1;ON 4/17/2008, A PRELIMINARY NOTICE WAS SENT TO ALL CLIENTS WITH SUNQUEST LABORATORY INSTRUCTING THEM TO IMMEDIATELY STOP PERFORMING ONLINE FILE CLEANUP ON ANY INSTRUMENT GENERATED ORDER INTERFACE. ONLINE FILE CLEANUP IS A PROCESS THAT CLEANS OUT OLD INSTRUMENT DATA AND SEQUENCE NUMBERS TO PROVIDE ROOM FOR NEW DATA. THE INSTRUMENT GENERATED ORDER INTERFACE IS ROUTINELY USED TO SEND POINT OF CARE TESTING TO THE LAB INFO SYSTEM (LIS). THE LIS USES PT INFO THAT IS SENT WITH THE RESULTS TO TRIGGER THE LIS TO GENERATE AN ORDER. THIS GIVES THE LIS AND IDENTIFIER WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESULTS. THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE ISSUE MANIFESTS ITSELF WHEN ONLINE FILE CLEANUP IS PERFORMED BEFORE THE LIS HAS COMPLETED THE GENERATION OF AN ORDER ON ALL THE POINT OF CARE RESULTS STORED IN A TEMPORARY GLOBAL. WHEN THIS OCCURS, A COUNTER DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE LAST SEQUENCE NUMBER THEREBY SETTING UP A SITUATION WHERE RESULTS SUSPENDED IN THE TEMPORARY FILE MAY BE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT PT THAT USES THE SAME SEQUENCE NUMBER. PRELIMINARY PROBLEM. SUNQUEST HAS IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM WITH INSTRUMENT GENERATED ORDER INTERFACES, USED ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH POINT OF CARE TESTING, THAT CAN LEAD TO THE RESULTS OF ONE PT OVERWRITING THAT OF ANOTHER PT. PERFORMING AN ONLINE FILE CLEANUP PRIOR TO ALL RESULTS BEING ASSIGNED AN IDENTIFIER MAY CAUSE THE PT RESULTS TO REMAIN IN A TEMPORARY FILE WHERE THEY CAN BE INCORRECTLY ASSOCIATED TO THE WRONG PT. WHEN THIS OCCURS, SUNQUEST GENERATED REPORTS AND INQUIRY CONTAINS THE INCORRECT RESULTS.

1036331;0;"INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THEY ARE HAVING AN ISSUE WITH HEMOGLOBIN (HGB) RECOVERY USING A CELL-DYN 3000CS ANALYZER. APPROXIMATELY TEN PT SAMPLES WERE AFFECTED, HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED ONLY ONE PT DATA EXAMPLE. THE CUSTOMER HAD CLEANED THE HGB FLOWCELL, EXERCISED VALVE 14 AND CHANGED THE PINCH TUBING FOR VALVES 14 AND 15 WITHOUT RESOLVING THE HGB ISSUE. QC (R&D CONTROL) WAS IN RANGE. A CUSTOMER TECHNICAL ADVOCATE (CTA) WALKED CUSTOMER THROUGH EXERCISES VALVES 13, 15, 41, 42, 44. CUSTOMER ALSO REPLACED PINCH TUBING IN VALVES 13, 41, 42, 44--ALL VALVES APPEARED TO OPERATE PROPERLY. THE HGB LYSE AND DILUENT SYRINGE WERE PROPERLY SEATED, NO BUBBLES WERE SEEN AND THE SYRINGE MOVEMENT WAS SMOOTH. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH REAGENT IN THE HGB MIXING CHAMBER AFTER CYCLING, WHICH DILUTED THE NEXT SAMPLE, CAUSING LOW HGB READINGS. FIELD SERVICE WAS DISPATCHED. FSR VISITED ON 4/17/2008 AND REPLACED, AS HARD FAILURE, FIVE WORN SOLENOID VALVES (V34, V35, V36, V37, V38). VERIFICATION PROCEDURE 3 (VP3) FOR SOLENOID OPERATION PASSED. VP8 (HGB FLOWCELL CLEANING AND ADJUSTMENT) WAS PERFORMED AND PASSED. THE CELL-DYN SYSTEM 3000 OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 92430-01, REV H: THE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE (SECTION 10 PAGES 10-25 TO 10-26) STATES THAT IN THE PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION STEP THE CUSTOMER SHOULD BE OBSERVING WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE CATEGORY OF PROBLEM (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR MEASUREMENT). SECTION 3, SAMPLE ANALYSIS CYCLE OVERVIEW OUTLINES THE PROCESS OF ANALYSIS (PAGES 3-2 TO 3-4). PRECISE VOLUMES OF BLOOD ARE DILUTED WITH SPECIFIC VOLUMES OF REAGENT ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF ANALYSIS BEING DONE. THE HGB DETERMINATION IS MADE FROM 1.2 UL OF BLOOD ADDED TO 1.5ML OF DILUENT AND 1.5ML HEMOGLOBIN LYSE REAGENT, WHICH IS MIXED BY BUBBLING ACTION IN THE HGB MIXING CHAMBER. THE MIXING CHAMBER AND FLOW CELLS ARE RINSED AFTER EACH CYCLE. THE VOLUME OF LIQUID IN THE MIXING CHAMBER SHOULD BE CONSISTENT CYCLE TO CYCLE. THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED WHILE CHECKING THE MOVEMENT OF SYRINGES AND VALVES, THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH REAGENT IN THE MIXING CHAMBER, WHICH INDICATED A MEASUREMENT PROBLEM FOR HGB ANALYSIS AT MIXING CHAMBER AND A POSSIBLE HARDWARE ISSUE RELATED TO THE FILL/DRAIN OF THE MIXING CHAMBER. TRENDING ANALYSIS: A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT REPORTS, FOR THE PERIOD AUGUST 2007 THROUGH MARCH 2008, DID NOT INDICATE ANY ADVERSE TREND WITH THE CELL-DYN 3000, LIST BASE 91250-01, (WHICH INCLUDED 91323-03) FOR ISSUES WITH ERRATIC/LOW HGB RESULTS. THERE WAS NO SYSTEMIC ISSUE. LABELING: THE EVENT IS ADDRESSED IN THE CELL-DYN 3000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 92420-01, REV H SECTION 3: PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION: SAMPLE ANALYSIS CYCLE OVERVIEW; 3-2 TO 3-4 SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE; 10-25 TO 10-26. CONCLUSION: THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE EVENT WAS EVALUATED. SERVICE REPLACED SOLENOID VALVES THAT WERE INTERMITTENTLY FAILING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. NO IMPACT TO PT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT.

1038640;1;"AFTER LOGGING IN ON AN INFINITY EXPLORER WORKSTATION OF A DEDICATED PT LOCATION INNOVIAN OPENS IN THE ""BOARDVIEW"" SCREEN INSTEAD OF THE ""PATIENTVIEW"" SCREEN, APPARENTLY, IT HAS LOST THE PT CONTEXT. THE USER OPENED A PT FILE FROM A DIFFERENT WARD ""ICT BED 6) INSTEAD OF ""ICC BED 6"". AFTER EVALUATING THIS PT'S FILE ""ICT BED 6"" ON THE SCREEN, THEY DECIDED THAT THE PT ON ""ICC BED 6"" NEEDED LASIX AND THAT WAS ADMITTED TO THE PT. THE ROOT CAUSE IS PROBABLY LYING IN THE IIS ON THE WINDOWS 2003 SERVER. AFTER A PERIOD, ALL WORK PROCESSES WERE RECYCLED AND THEREFORE, ALL CONNECTIONS WERE LOST. IF THE EXPLORER IS RECONNECTED, THE ""BOARDVIEW"" SCREEN IS PRESENTED. THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION SUGGESTS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS 2 FOLD, IIS ON THE MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM WINDOWS 2003 AND THE USER ERROR. THE IIS ON THE WINDOWS 2003 CAUSED TIMEOUT ON THE INNOVIAN APPLICATION AND HENCE RESULTED IN DISPLAY OF ""BOARDVIEW"" SCREEN RATHER THAN THE ""PATIENTVIEW"" SCREEN. INNOVIAN ONCE OPENED IN ""BOARDVIEW"", PROVIDES A LIST OF BED LOCATIONS WITH ASSOCIATED PT NAMES FOR THE USER TO SELECT. IN THIS CASE, THE USER PROBABLY SELECTED THE RIGHT BED NUMBER, BUT THE WRONG WARD WITHOUT VERIFYING THE PT'S NAME. IF THE SESSION DOES TIMEOUT ON THE INFINITY EXPLORER AND THEY ARE LOGGED OUT OF INNOVIAN, THERE IS A REFRESH BUTTON ON THE EXPLORER THAT THEY CAN SELECT WHICH WILL LOG THEM BACK INTO INNOVIAN IN SINGLE PT MODE ""PATIENTVIEW"". INNOVIAN DID NOT SUPPORT SERVER 2003 UNTIL THE VF4.0 RELEASE IN 3RD QUARTER 2006. BEFORE THAT INNOVIAN RAN ON WINDOWS 2000 WHICH DID NOT HAVE THIS IIS RESET ISSUE. DRAEGER DEVICE DID NOT CAUSE THIS EVENT. CURRENTLY WE ARE INVESTIGATION CHANGES THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW INFINITY EXPLORER TO LOGING TO INNOVIAN IN BOARD VIEW."

1051257;1;"THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF PT HARM. THE PRODUCT PROBLEM OBSERVED IN 2008 WAS ASSESSED BY OUR MDR EVALUATION PROCESS TO HAVE BEEN A MALFUNCTION OF THE IMPAX PRODUCT, WHICH IF IT WERE TO RECUR COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A SERIOUS INJURY. A RADIOLOGIST WAS VIEWING AN ULTRASOUND ON A PT WHEN A MAMMOGRAPHY TECHNOLOGIST CAME IN AND ASKED HIM TO LOOK AT SOME MAMMOGRAPHY FILMS. HE GOT UP FROM HIS WORKSTATION AND WAS LOOKING AT THE FILMS ON THE VIEWBOX BEHIND HIS DESK. AS HE WAS LOOKING AT THESE FILMS, HE NOTICED A ""FLICKER"" OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE THAT CAME FROM HIS WORKSTATION. WHEN HE LOOKED OVER AT HIS WORKSTATION, THERE WAS A BONE SCAN STUDY BEING DISPLAYED ON A DIFFERENT PT THAN WHAT HE WAS ORIGINALLY LOOKING AT. ON THE TEXT PAGE, THE INFO FROM THE ORIGINAL UNTRASOUND PT WAS DISPLAYED. NO ERRONEOUS ACTION WAS TAKEN, BUT IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS PRODUCT PROBLEM COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO AN ERRONEOUS REPORT OR POSSIBLY A MISDIAGNOSIS: IF IT GOES UNNOTICED THAT THE STUDY BEING REPORTED ON IS NO LONGER THE ONE THAT IS ACTIVE. ALSO, IF THE IMAGES BEING VIEWED ARE COINCIDENTALLY OF THE SAME BODY PART AND MODALITY THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO AN IRREVERSIBLE INJURY. THIS PRODUCT MALFUNCTION IS EXACERBATED WHEN USERS CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE TO VIEW IMAGES WITH ALL DEMOGRAPHICS REMOVED. AGFA RECOMMENDS AGAINST THIS PRACTICE; THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN TAKEN DIRECTLY OUT OF THE KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR THE IMPAX 6.X CLIENT: ""CAUTION! WE DO NOT ADVISE TURNING OFF ALL PT DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE IMAGE AREA. CONFIGURING THE CLIENT SO NO PT DEMOGRAPHICS ARE IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE IN THE IMAGE AREA INTRODUCES A RISK OF MISIDENTIFYING A PATIENT."""
1051313;1;"THE ISSUE INVOLVES THE ORDER ENTRY FORMATS IN POWERORDERS AND AFFECTS SITES THAT USE POWERORDERS AND MEDICATION PROFILE. WHEN CREATING THE VOLUME DOSE DETAIL IN THE ORDER ENTRY FORMATS (OEF), THE STRENGTH ORDER FORMATS REQUIRE THE VOLUME DOSE TO HAVE AN ""="" SIGN AS A PREFIX LABEL. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS BUILD CAN RESULT IN AN INPATIENT PRESCRIPTION ORDER CONVERTED TO PRODUCE AN OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION THAT MAY BE MISLEADING. THIS ONLY OCCURS WHEN THE INPATIENT ORDER USED IS VERIFIED WITH A PHARMACY PRODUCT AND THE FORMULATION USED DOES NOT EXACTLY MATCH THE DOSE. A FORMULATION FACTOR OF MORE OR LESS THAN ONE IS USED TO ACHIEVE THE VOLUME AND THE ORDER IS THEN CONVERTED TO A PRESCRIPTION. FOR EXAMPLE, 500 MG = 1 TAB OR 250 MG TIMES 2 TABS = 500 MG. PATIENT CARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS A PATIENT COULD RECEIVE EITHER MORE OR LESS OF A MEDICATION THERAPY THAN INTENDED. CERNER HAS RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF ORDER DISCREPANCIES DISCOVERED DURING A CHART REVIEW AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. CERNER HAS DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION MAY 23, 2008 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENTS SITES. THE NOTIFICATION INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND AN INTERIM WORKFLOW ADJUSTMENT TO PREVENT THE MALFUNCTION. USER DOCUMENTATION IS BEING UPDATED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR ALL SITES THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED. CERNER CORPORATION WILL PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WHEN THE DOCUMENTATION IS AVAILABLE."
1051315;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A MAP SHIFT DURING A DEMO TRAINING. THERE WAS NO PT CONSEQUENCES.
1051368;0;VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED SAMPLE DID CONFIRM CUSTOMER REPORTED FAILURE MODE, IN THE FORM OF A BLACK FOREIGN BODY ADHERED TO INNER WALL OF SYRINGE BARREL. FURTHER VISUAL INSPECTION UNDER MICROSCOPE 10X IT WAS UNDETERMINED THE COMPOSITION OF PARTICULATE, INSPECTION YIELDED THAT PARTICULATE WAS NOT PART OF THE ANY MOLDED SUB-ASSEMBLY. THIS CONFIRMED BY FACT THAT NO LOOSE GATE REMNANTS OR FLASHES WERE SEEN ON ANY MOLDED COMPONENT. THERE WAS A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS OF THE LF MANUFACTURING LINE FROM MARCH 2005 TO MAY 2005 WERE BOTH EQUIPMENTS AND PERSONNEL CLEANING AND GOWNING PRACTICES, IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF FOREIGN OBJECTS WHICH WERE ADDRESSED AS LISTED BELOW. CONCLUSIONS/CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: THE NEXT ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE FOREIGN OBJECTS IN PRODUCT OR ITS PACKAGE. REINFORCE THE 6S PROGRAM IN MANUFACTURING AREA, WHICH CONSISTS ON DAILY CLEANING ROUTINES BY OUR MANUFACTURING PERSONNEL DURING SHIFT TRANSITIONS. MATERIAL HANDLING PRACTICES WERE CHANGED TO PREVENT THE ADHESION OF FOREIGN PARTICLES TO COMPONENTS SUCH AS THE ROLL STOCK WHICH IS THE RAW MATERIAL FOR THE SYRINGE TRAY. STICKY MATS WERE INSTALLED IN THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE MANUFACTURING AREA TO COLLECT THE DUST FORM THE PERSONNEL SHOES BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE ASSEMBLY AREA. GOWNING PRACTICES WERE REVIEWED WITH ALL LF ASSEMBLY LINE PERSONNEL TO REINFORCE ITS CORRECT APPLICATION WHICH INCLUDE THE ADEQUATE USE AND REPLACEMENT OF HEAD COVERS. REPORTER REPORTS: TWO SYRINGE BARREL WITH BLACK FOREIGN BODY TO BE ATTACHED TO INSIDE OF THEM WERE FOUND. ONE WAS COLLECTED BY US. THE OTHER WAS DISPOSED BY THE HOSPITAL.
1051369;0;YUFU REPORTS: THE OBJECT LIKE DUST WAS FOUND TO COME FROM INSIDE OF THE SYRINGE DURING INJECTION. THEY CHECKED THE ROUTE OF THE CONTAMINATION, AND THEY SUSPECTED THE SYRINGE MAY BE. AS THE DUST IS BIG ENOUGH TO FIND EASILY, THEY COULD STOP INJECTION BEFORE SERIOUS PROBLEM OCCURS. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD DOES NOT HAVE EVIDENCE OF ANY ABNORMAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. NONE OF THE 20 INSPECTED UNITS SHOWED THE COMPLAINT CONDITION REPORTED, UPON THESE RESULTS THE PRODUCT WAS RELEASED FOR DISTRIBUTION. CONCLUSIONS: UPON VISUAL INSPECTION OF SAMPLE RECEIVED THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE FOREIGN OBJECTS IN PRODUCT OR ITS PACKAGE. REINFORCE THE 6S PROGRAM IN MANUFACTURING AREA, WHICH CONSISTS ON DAILY CLEANING ROUTINES BY OUR MANUFACTURING PERSONNEL DURING SHIFT TRANSITIONS.

THIS REPRESENTS A COMPLETE OPPOSITE SHIFT FROM ONE REPORTING SCREEN TO ANOTHER. THIS IS CURRENTLY SHOWING THIS BEHAVIOR FOR TWO PTS. RECREATING THE PTS' DATA INFO SOLVED THE ISSUE. CUSTOMER DID NOT TREAT PTS BASED ON THE CONFLICTING SHIFTS. ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE ERROR WITH THE ORIGINAL DATA, BUT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS NOT APPARENT. SOFTWARE ENGINEERS WERE ABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM BY CHANGING THE DRR GANTRY ANGLE IN THE VIEW DRR - DRR VIEWER AND INITIALIZERON SCREEN. IN THIS DIALOG SCREEN THE DRRS FOR THE PT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED EARLIER, THEN SELECTING THE CANCEL OR CLOSE FORM BOX WILL CAUSE THE UP/DOWN FIELD TO BECOME INVERTED AND THE LOCALIZATION MOVE WILL BE INCORRECT. THE PROBLEM: WHEN THE CANCEL BUTTON IS SELECTED TO GO FORWARD THAT THE SYSTEM DOES NOT UPDATE THE FILES CONTAINING THE DRR GANTRY ANGLE INFO, OR SFD, HOWEVER, THE PORTAL IMAGE MARKER DOES USE THE INFO FROM MEMORY.

THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT SHE FELT SHAKY AND NERVOUS. SHE DRANK SOME SWEET TEA AND FELT BETTER SHORTLY AFTERWARD. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. NEW SYSTEM SENT TO CUSTOMER AND RETURN REQUESTED.
1058108;0;REPORTING OF THIS COMPLAINT AT THIS TIME IS BASED ON A PREVIOUSLY FILED SERIOUS INJURY MDR FOR COMPLAINT. AS A RESULT OF THAT INJURY REPORT, A 2-YR REPORTING TIMEFRAME WAS INITIATED FOR TALL COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME TYPE. ALL COMPLAINT FILES FOR THE LADARVISION4000 WERE REVIEWED FOR THIS TYPE OF EVENT STARTING 2007. THIS MDR FILING IS A RESULT OF THAT RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW. EVENT PROBLEM CODES PROVIDED BY THE MFR. A SURGERY DATABASE PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION WAS CONDUCTED ON THIS SYS AND THE ANALYSIS INDICATED THE LASER PERFORMANCE FACTORS ANALYZED WERE OPERATING WITHIN SPECIFICATION DURING THE TIME OF THIS PT'S SURGERY. INVESTIGATION INCLUDING ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS IN PROGRESS. A SUPPLEMENTAL MDR WILL BE FILED AS NECESSARY IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803.56 WHEN ADD'L REPORTABLE INFO BECOMES AVAILABLE. A NURSE REPORTS A PT WITH A POSSIBLE DECENTERED ABLATION. THIS REPORT IS FOR THE RIGHT EYE, THE LEFT EYE IS BEING REPORTED UNDER MFR'S REPORT NUMBER 1061857-2008-00098. PT RECORDS WERE RECEIVED AND DID NOT INDICATE AN INJURY FOR THE RIGHT EYE. UCVA IMPROVED FROM 20/CF TO 20/30+3 AT 1 DAY POST-OP. NO OTHER VISUAL DIFFICULTIES WERE NOTED IN THE PT'S RECORDS. THE SURGEON STATED THERE WAS NO PT HARM/INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. ADD'L INFO HAS BEEN REQUESTED.
1058257;0;THE DISTRIBUTOR REPORTED THAT THE PUMP EXHIBITED EXCESSIVE NOISE DURING REWIND, THE PUMP WAS RETURNED TO ANIMAS FOR EVAL. EVAL REVEALED A DAMAGED CIRCUIT BOARD. THE PUMP WAS EVALUATED AND FOUND TO HAVE A DAMAGED CIRCUIT BOARD.
1058503;1;"A CUSTOMER REPORTED TO BECKMAN COULTER INC. (BCI) THAT DATALINK2000 DATA MANAGER (DL2000) INCORRECTLY REPORTED VALPROIC ACID (VPA) RESULTS TO THE LAB INFO SYSTEM (LIS). SEVERAL SAMPLES WERE TESTED FOR VPA AND ONE PT QUESTIONED THE RESULTS. UPON DATA REVIEW, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT INCORRECT RESULTS WERE REPORTED FOR 4 SAMPLES: ACTUAL VPA RESULTS AT INSTRUMENT WERE: 87.5UG/ML, 87.1UG/ML, 68.0UG/ML, AND 23UG/ML FOR SAMPLES 1-4 RESPECTIVELY ALL 4 RESULTS WERE REPORTED BY THE DL2000 AS ""<10UG/ML"". IT IS UNKNOWN IF TREATMENT WAS INITIATED OR WITHHELD AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. IN 2008, THE DL2000 WAS UPGRADED TO VERSION 6.5 FROM VERSION 6.4. A RULE FOR LOW LEVELS OF VPA HAD BEEN CONFIGURED ON THE DL2000, BUT IT WAS NOT RE-VALIDATED AFTER THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE. PER CUSTOMER, THE RULE HAD BEEN CONFIGURED PRIOR TO THE UPGRADE, BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO INSTANCES OF VPA RESULTS BEING IMPROPERLY CHANGED TO ""<10UG/ML"" WITH VERSION 6.4. UPON CHECKING ALL VPA RESULTS REPORTED FROM 04/01/08 TO PRESENT, ONLY SAMPLES REPORTED SINCE THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE ON ORIGINAL DATE, WERE INCORRECT. EVAL OF THE RULE SHOWS SYNTAX ERRORS IN THE RULE, COMBINED WITH VERSION 6.5 SOFTWARE. BCI DID CONFIGURE THE RULE ON AN IN-HOUSE DL2000, AND CONFIRMED THAT THE RULE ONLY CHANGE RESULTS WITH VERSION 6.5. THE ERRORS IN THIS RULE WERE CORRECTED AND THE ISSUE HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO THE SOFTWARE VENDOR FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. A FALSE NEGATIVE RESULT IN A RECURRENT SITUATION COULD PLACE A PATIENT(S) AT RISK WITH VALUES ROUND THE TOXIC LEVEL THRESHOLD NOT PROPERLY REPORTED. THE ROOT CAUSE APPEARS TO BE A RULE WITH SYNTAX ERRORS, COMBINED WITH VERSION 6.5 SOFTWARE. A MALFUNCTION WILL BE ASSUMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT."
1058531;0;"DURING AN ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY (ERCP), THE PHYSICIAN USED A COOK ENDOSCOPY HOWELL D.A.S.H. SPHINCTEROTOME. (NOTE: THIS SPHINCTEROTOME IS PROVIDED WITH A PRELOADED WIRE GUIDE.) DURING ADVANCEMENT OF THE WIRE GUIDE THROUGH THE SPHINCTEROTOME, THE WIRE GUIDE EXITED THE SIDE OF THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING NEAR THE DISTAL END. WHEN THE WIRE GUIDE WAS PULLED BACK INTO THE SPHINCTEROTOME, THE COATING OF THE WIRE GUIDE TIP SEPARATED NEAR THE DISTAL END BUT DID NOT DETACH FROM THE WIRE GUIDE. ANOTHER SPHINCTEROTOME AND WIRE GUIDE WERE USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. A FOREIGN OBJECT DID NOT HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED FROM THE PATIENT. NO ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PROCEDURES WERE REQUIRED DUE TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE PATIENT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS DUE TO THIS OBSERVATION. EVALUATION: OUR EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE CONFIRMED THE REPORT OF WIRE GUIDE COATING SEPARATION AT THE DISTAL END. THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING HAS SPLIT APPROXIMATELY 1.5CM BEGINNING AT THE DISTAL TIP. THE WIRE GUIDE WAS RETURNED EXITING THE SPLIT AREA OF THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING. THE WIRE GUIDE COATING HAS FOLDED BACK, EXPOSING 3CM OF THE INNER CORE WIRE. THE COATING DID NOT DETACH FROM THE WIRE GUIDE. NO PORTION OF THE WIRE GUIDE COATING IS MISSING. NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE WIRE GUIDE WAS OBSERVED. NO ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS WERE NOTED. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THIS LOT NUMBER, WE CAN REPORT THAT NO DISCREPANCIES OR ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. WE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THIS LOT BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED. A REVIEW OF THE TWELVE MONTH COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS RARE. CONCLUSION: DUE TO A VARIETY OF CLINICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS PATIENT ANATOMY, ENDOSCOPE POSITION OR PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE STATE, WE CAN NOT REPRODUCE THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS OF DEVICE USAGE. WHILE CLINICAL CONDITIONS ARE NOT THE SOLE DETERMINING FACTORS, THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE THE CAUSE FOR THIS OBSERVATION. HOWEVER, WE CAN PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS: DAMAGE TO THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING CAN OCCUR IF THE DISTAL END OF THE TUBING IS SHAPED MANUALLY OR IF THE PACKAGING STYLET IS FORCEFULLY REMOVED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING COMMENT: ""NOTE: DO NOT APPLY MANUAL PRESSURE TO THE TIP OR CUTTING WIRE OF THE SPHINCTEROTOME IN AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE ORIENTATION, AS THIS MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE DEVICE."" ANOTHER FACTOR THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DAMAGE TO THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING IS MANIPULATING THE HANDLE WITH THE PACKAGING STYLET INSIDE THE TUBING. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE ADVISE THE USER TO STRAIGHTEN THE DEVICE AND REMOVE THE PACKAGING STYLET FROM THE TUBING PRIOR TO HANDLE MANIPULATION. IF THE WIRE GUIDE EXITS THE DAMAGED AREA OF THE SPHINCTEROTOME CATHETER TUBING AND ADDITIONAL PRESSURE IS APPLIED DURING AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE WIRE GUIDE, THE COATING MAY BECOME COMPROMISED. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL HOWELL D.A.S.H. SPHINCTEROTOMES (AND THE PRELOADED WIRE GUIDES) UNDERGO A VISUAL INSPECTION TO ENSURE DEVICE INTEGRITY. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD CONFIRMED THAT THIS LOT MET MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. CORRECTIVE ACTION: A CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN INITIATED IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE OCCURRENCES OF WIRE GUIDE COATING SEPARATION NEAR THE DISTAL END. THIS PRODUCT WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CORRECTIVE ACTION. THE COMPLAINT RISK PRIORITY NUMBER (CRPN) FOR THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTCOME. BASED ON THIS ACTIVITY, NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS RATE. CUSTOMER QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS."
1058583;1;THE ISSUE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND ADDITIONAL INFO WILL BE PROVIDED WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. IT WAS REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER, SOME REPORT EXAMS ARE INADVERTENTLY GETTING MARKED AS DICTATED IN PACS (PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM) WORKSTATION FOR NO APPARENT REASON. PER THE RADIOLOGIST, THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING TO TRIGGER THE DICTATED UPDATE BEYOND VIEWING THE EXAM. THE CUSTOMER GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE EXAM THAT WAS MARKED DICTATED WITHOUT AN ATTACHED REPORT. A PT WAS ADMITTED AND WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY BEFORE THE EXAM WAS INTERPRETED. THE EXAM WAS MARKED DICTATED BUT, THERE WAS NO REPORT ATTACHED. ALSO, THERE WAS NO REPORT OF PT BEING HARMED OR MISTREATED. THE SITUATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ISOLATED TO ANY PARTICULAR WORKSTATION.

TWO DAYS LATER, A WARNING MESSAGE APPEARED IN THE LOGS INDICATING THE ""STOPPED PUMP PERIOD MAY EXCEED TUBE SET."" THE MOTOR STALL WAS CAUSED BY THE PT HAVING AN MRI. THE ERROR MESSAGE WAS FOUND IN TWO MONTHS LATER, WHEN THE PT WAS SEEN BY THEIR HCP. A MOTOR STALL RECOVERY MESSAGE APPEARED IN THE LOGS FOR THE DATE AND TIME THE PUMP WAS INTERROGATED IN MAY. THE PT HAD NO SYMPTOMS. THE DRUG USED IN THE PUMP IS BACLOFEN 2000 MCG/ML AT A DOSE OF 150.2 MCG/DAY."
1058978;1;"THE EVMS PACS HAS A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO MARK AN ANCHOR STUDY AS READ, AND THEN MARKS ALL OTHER SERIES IN THAT STUDY/CORRELATED STUDIES AS READ. THIS ALLOWS USERS TO VIEW ALL CASES RELATED TO A STUDY AND CLOSE ALL AS READ FOR ENHANCED WORKFLOW. A WARNING MESSAGE IS PROVIDED TO THE USER THAT ALL STUDIES ARE BEING MARKED AS READ AND THE USER MUST PLACE A CHECK NEXT TO EACH SERIES AND CLICK 'OK' PRIOR TO CLOSING IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE HAZARD THAT THEY WOULD BE MARKING SERIES AS 'READ' THAT THEY HAD NOT READ. THIS FEATURE CAN BE TURNED ON OR OFF; THE DEFAULT IS TO MARK ALL AS READ WITH THE WARNING MESSAGE TURNED ON. THIS ALSO APPEARS IN THE LABELING. A USER CALLED IN A COMPLAINT THAT THEIR SERIES/CORRELATED STUDIES HAVE BEEN MARKED AS READ WITHOUT THEM BEING AWARE OF IT. THE LOG FILE SHOWED THAT THE WARNING MESSAGE HAD BEEN TURNED OFF USING THAT USER'S LOGIN AND PASSWORD; HOWEVER, THE USER WAS NOT AWARE THAT THEY CHANGED IT. AS A RESULT, THE USER MISSED 2 FRACTURES ON AN INITIAL READ, BUT THE ER PHYSICIAN WAS AWARE THAT THERE WERE FRACTURES SO NO ADVERSE OUTCOMES WERE NOTED. THE SUGGESTED USE OF THE DEVICE IS TO LEAVE THE WARNING MESSAGE TURNED ON IF A USER OPTS TO MARK ALL STUDIES AS READ WHEN THE ANCHOR STUDY IS MARKED AS READ. HOWEVER, SOME USERS DO OPT TO TURN IT OFF BECAUSE THEIR WORKFLOW DICTATES THAT THEY MUST REVIEW ALL SERIES IN A STUDY PRIOR TO MARKING THE ANCHOR AS READ. IF THE WORKFLOW AT A SITE DOES NOT DICTATE THIS, THE MESSAGE IS RECOMMENDED TO BE LEFT ON IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE HAZARD. FOR THIS PARTICULAR USER'S SITE, AN ENHANCEMENT IS BEING ADDED TO THE SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS THE USER TO SET THE FUNCTION TO NEVER MARK ALL STUDIES AS READ IF THE ANCHOR IS MARKED AS READ. THIS WILL BE AN INDIVIDUALIZED SETTING PER USER."
1059171;0;THE REPORTED BLOOD LOSS IS ATTRIBUTED TO CLOTTING OF THE CIRCUIT PREVENTING RINSEBACK OF THE PT'S BLOOD. FACILITY STAFF ATTRIBUTED THE ARTERIAL PRESSURE ALARMS TO ISSUES WITH THE PT'S ACCESS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE MALFUNCTION. THE CYCLER ALARMED APPROPRIATELY. A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN NXSTAGE SYSTEM ONE AND THE REPORTED BLOOD LOSS CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED. NXSTAGE MEDICAL CONSIDERS THIS REPORT CLOSED. NO ADD'L INFO WILL BE PROVIDED. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS AN ADVERSE EVENT SOLELY TO COMPLY WITH THE FDA'S BLOOD LOSS POLICY. ARTERIAL PRESSURE ALARMS ATTRIBUTED TO INADEQUATE BLOOD FLOW FROM THE PT'S VASCULAR ACCESS, OCCURRED DURING A ROUTINE HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT. RINSEBACK WAS NOT PERFORMED DUE TO POSSIBLE CLOTTING, RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS OF 190CC. NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED.
1059315;0;AN ELEVATED ADVIA 1650 ISE POTASSIUM (K+) PATIENT SAMPLE RESULT WAS REPORTED TO THE PHYSICIAN AND UPON REPEAT, THE RESULT WAS NORMAL. PATIENT TREATMENT WAS PRESCRIBED BUT UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCE DUE TO THE DISCORDANT POTASSIUM RESULT. A SIEMENS FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS SENT TO THE CUSTOMER SITE. ANALYSIS OF THE INSTRUMENT AND INSTRUMENT DATA INDICATE THE CAUSE FOR THE DISCREPANT RESULTS WAS DUE TO A LEAKING BUFFER PUMP WHICH THE FSE REPAIRED. THE INSTRUMENT IS PERFORMING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. NO FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE IS REQUIRED.
1059660;0;FORTY-ONE MONTHS AFTER PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) WITH TWO OVERLAPPING CYPHER STENTS, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAIN AND WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS CONDUCTED AND THROMBUS WAS OBSERVED INSIDE THE CYPHER FROM THE PROXIMAL END OF THE STENT. TO TREAT THE THROMBUS, ASPIRATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH A REBIRTH PRO AND PLAIN OLD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (POBA) WAS CONDUCTED WITH A 3.5X15MM POWERED LACROSSE: BALLOON. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL 10 DAYS LATER. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS BECAUSE THE TICLOPIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE ONE YEAR HAD PASSED SINCE THE STENT WAS IMPLANTED. THIS PATIENT PRESENTED FOR ELECTIVE TREATMENT OF A CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY OF 30MM IN LENGTH IN A 3.5MM VESSEL DIAMETER. THE (TYPE C) LESION WAS CHARACTERIZED AS OSTIAL. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X18MM BALLOON AT 4 ATMOSPHERES BEFORE A 3.0X18MM CYPHER STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 16 ATM. THEN A 3.5X23MM CYPHER STENT AT 16 ATM PROXIMAL TO THE PREVIOUS STENT IN AN OVERLAPPING MANNER. POST-DILATION WAS NOT CONDUCTED. INTRA-VASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) WAS NOT CONDUCTED. THE RESIDUAL % OF STENOSIS MEASURED 0%. THROMBIN INHIBITION IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (TIMI) FLOW BEFORE THE PROCEDURE WAS UNKNOWN AND AFTER THE PROCEDURE WAS 3. ACT WAS NOT MEASURED. PRE-PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASPIRIN 100 MG/DAY. INTRA-PROCEDURE INCLUDED ASPIRIN 100 MG/DAY: AND HEPARIN 5,000U. POST-PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED TICLOPIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE 200 MG/DAY FOR ONE YEAR. A MALE EXPERIENCED A VERY LATE THROMBOTIC EVENT APPROXIMATELY THREE AND A HALF YEARS POST IMPLANTATION OF TWO CYPHER STENTS. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDES UNSTABLE ANGINA PECTORIS, HYPERTENSION AND PREVIOUS PCI. THE PATIENT HAD AN ELECTIVE PCI TO TREAT A LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LAD. THE VESSEL WAS A DE-NOVO, OSTIAL AND CTO LESION. AHA/ACC CLASSIFICATION OF THE VESSEL WAS TYPE C. THE ACC DEFINES A TYPE C LESION AS A HIGH-RISK LESION WITH LESS THAN 60% SUCCESS RATE OF TREATMENT. THE LESION LENGTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 30MM IN A 3.5MM VESSEL DIAMETER. PRE-DILATION WAS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE IMPLANTATION OF 3.0X18MM CYPHER AND A 3.5X23MM CYPHER IN AN OVERLAPPING MANNER. MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE INCLUDED PERMANENT ASPIRIN AND TICLOPIDINE FOR 12 MONTHS. THREE YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN AND CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED THROMBUS WITHIN THE STENTS. THROMBUS ASPIRATION AND BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS CONDUCTED. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED 10 DAYS LATER IN STABLE CONDITION. THE PRODUCTS REMAIN IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT AND ARE THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW WAS PERFORMED AND SHOWED THAT THESE LOTS OF PRODUCTS MET ALL REQUIREMENTS PER THE APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING QUALITY PLAN. THROMBOTIC EVENTS ARE A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION. PATIENTS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE AT HIGH-RISK FOR THROMBOTIC EVENTS INCLUDE THOSE WITH LONG LESIONS. ACCORDING TO THE IFU, THIS PRODUCT IS INDICATED FOR USE IN DISCRETE LESIONS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 30MM IN LENGTH AND CONTRAINDICATED IN OSTIAL LESIONS OR LESIONS IN THE BIFURCATED AREA. THE SUM OF THE LENGTH OF THE TWO OVERLAPPING STENTS MEASURED 41MM. THE JAPAN IFU CAUTIONS THAT THE PERIOD OF ANTIPLATELET ADMINISTRATION MUST BE PROLONGED OR SHORTENED APPROPRIATELY DEPENDING ON EACH PATIENT'S CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, FOLLOW-UPS MUST BE CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION IS TERMINATED TO CONSIDER THE RESTART OF THE ANTIPLATELET ADMINISTRATION DEPENDING ON THE NECESSITY. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS BECAUSE TICLOPIDINE ADMINISTRATION WAS DISCONTINUED AFTER 12 MONTHS OF THERAPY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, THERE ARE POSSIBLE VESSEL, PROCEDURAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEVICE IS NOT DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE US DISTRIBUTED PRODUCT. IT IS ALSO NOT AVAILABLE FOR TESTING AND EVALUATION. THIS IS ONE OF TWO DEVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED EVENT THAT WERE SUBMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING MANUFACTURING NUMBERS: 9616099-2008-01487 AND 9616099-2008-01488.
1059696;0;DURING THE FIRING OF A PLCR60B RELOAD VIA AN I60 IN A SMALL BOWEL RESECTION PROCEDURE STAPLES WERE DEPLOYED, BUT THE I60 COULD NOT BE OPENED AFTER FIRING. THE I60 WAS CUT OUT OF THE TISSUE, AND THE TISSUE WAS OVERSEWN. WHEN THE RETURNED I60 WAS TESTED IT MET THE VISUAL AND FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE DEVICE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT OBSERVED DURING THE PROCEDURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.
1059729;0;ON 14 MAY 2008, ABBOTT SPINE BECAME AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING EVENT. THIS PT ENROLLED IN 2004, IN A POST MARKETING STUDY. AT APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS LATER, THE PT UNDERWENT A TRADITIONAL L5-S1 PROCEDURE. IN 2005, THE PT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN LOW BACK PAIN. THE EVENT OF INCREASE IN LOW BACK PAIN HAD NOT RESOLVED. IN 2007, THE PT UNDERWENT A REVISION SURGERY DUE TO PAIN. INTRA-OPERATIVE DURAL TEAR WITH CEREBROSPINAL FLUID LEAK WAS REPAIRED. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL PER SURGEON'S COMMENTS. NO FURTHER INFO IS AVAILABLE. NO DEVICE WILL BE RETURNED. THE EVENT WAS DOCUMENTED AS A RESULT OF A POST MARKETED STUDY. INVESTIGATION PENDING.

A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD HANDHELD FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1060545;0;DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE ARTHROSCOPIC SHAVER WAS EMITTING METAL SHAVINGS IN THE SURGICAL SITE. NO PATIENT INJURY WAS REPORTED. UPON RECEIPT, THE USED DEVICE WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FOUND TO HAVE SIGNS OF ABRASION AND GALLING ON THE OUTER SHAFT. INSPECTION OF THE INNER SHAFT REVEALED GALLING MARKS ALONG THE SHAFT AND A VISIBLE GOUGE ON THE INNER SHAFT. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE FOR SHAVING GENERATION WAS THE EXCESSIVE EXERTION OF LATERAL FORCES (SIDE LOADING) ON ARTHROSCOPIC SHAVER INSTRUMENTS DURING CLINICAL USE. ASCENT HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS' IFU STATES: DO NOT APPLY EXCESSIVE PRESSURE OR SIDE-LOAD THE BLADE DURING USE. SIDE-LOADING DOES NOT IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INSTRUMENT, CAN DULL THE BLADE, AND/OR PRODUCE METAL PARTICULATES. THE LOT CONTROL SHEET DOCUMENTING THE PROCESSING OF THIS DEVICE WAS REVIEWED AND NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND, INDICATING THE DEVICE PASSED ALL APPLICABLE INSPECTIONS AND TESTS AND WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION.

THE CONSUMER REPORTED THAT THE HCP SEVERED HIS ARTERY DURING THE IMPLANT SURGERY. THE PATIENT HAD PAIN, ITCHING AND NO PAIN RELIEF AND STATED HE WAS WORSE OF THEN BEFORE THE IMPLANT. FURTHER INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTED THAT DURING THE FIRST SURGERY THE DOCTOR HAD NICKED AN ARTERY IN HIS BACK AND HE WAS SLOWLY BLEEDING TO DEATH SO THE DOCTOR REMOVED THE PADDLE AND �PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER�. THE PATIENT HAD ANOTHER LEAD IMPLANTED AT A LATER DATE BUT THE NERVES HAD BEEN BOTHERED ENOUGH SO THE THERAPY NEVER TARGETED WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. THE PATIENT NOTED IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE LOWER SPINE BUT WAS IN THE UPPER TORSO AND A MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVE TRIED TO ADJUST STIMULATION 4-5 TIMES WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE SECOND IMPLANT. THEY NEVER COULD GET IT TARGETED APPROPRIATELY SO THE PATIENT STOPPED USING IT. THE INDICATION FOR USE WAS CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

1060683;1;"CERNER MILLENNIUM COMPUTER SYSTEM - VERSION 2007.9 - USED HERE AT OUR ORGANIZATION FOR PHYSICIAN MEDICATION ORDERS -CPOE-, NURSING DOCUMENTATION, AND PHARMACY PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING HAS SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES RELATED TO DISPLAYING SMALLER VOLUME VALUES. THE DEFICIENCY IS FELT BY OUR ORGANIZATION TO BE A PT SAFETY CONCERN, WHICH IS WHY THE REPORT IS BEING GENERATED. THE PT SAFETY ISSUES ARE DETAILED BELOW. ISSUE #1, WHEN THE DISPENSED VOLUMES ARE ASSIGNED BY THE SYSTEM, THE VOLUMES ARE ROUNDED TO 0.01 MLS. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC WHEN NEW SYRINGES ON THE MARKET ARE CAPABLE OF DRAWING DOSES IN 0.005 ML INCREMENTS. THEREFORE, A DOSE OF DESMOPRESSIN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 0.025 ML = 0.1 MCG IS ROUNDED TO 0.03 ML= 0.12 MCG, WHICH REPRESENTS A 20% ERROR IN THE DOSE. THIS ISSUE IS HARD CODED AND NOT A PREFERENCE THAT WE CAN CONTROL. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN RAISED WITH VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS AT CERNER WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION. THIS PROBLEM HAS ALSO BEEN RAISED BY AT LEAST 2 OTHER CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS; THEREFORE, OUR HOSPITAL IS NOT ALONE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE. ISSUE #2, WHEN THE VOLUME IS LESS THAN 0.01 ML, THE VOLUME DOES NOT DISPLAY WITH THE ORDER -NOTE: NORMALLY IT DOES-. BEFORE PHARMACY VERIFICATION, THE ORDER READS AS FOLLOWS ""XX MG/N/A ML"". THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE THE NURSE TRYING TO ADMINISTER THE DOSE WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE THE VOLUME TO BE ADMINISTERED. RELATED TO THIS, WE ALMOST HAD A 10 FOLD INSULIN ERROR RELATED TO THIS SPECIFIC DEFECT. SECONDLY, WHEN THE PHARMACIST TRIES TO VERIFY THE ORDER, THE ORDER FAILS IN THE PROCESSING. THIS ISSUE HAS ALSO BEEN RAISED WITH THE CERNER CORP WITHOUT A RESOLUTION."

1061036;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SURGEON INSERTED A CC4204BF COLLAMER PLATE LENS, AND THE LENS WAS TORN DURING INSERTION. THE LENS WAS REMOVED WITHOUT ANY PT INJURY. EVAL: RESULTS - VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED PRODUCT SHOWED THAT A HAPTIC PLATE WAS TORN OFF FROM THE OPTIC AND MISSING AND THERE WAS A CLEAR SURGICAL RESIDUE ON THE LENS. CONCLUSION - AN INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED TO EVALUATE A COMPLAINT TREND ASSOCIATED WITH LENS TEARS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED IN JUNE 2005. THE DAMAGE TO THE LENS, AS OBSERVED AND PHOTOGRAPHED UPON THE RETURN OF THE LENS TO STAAR, CAN NOT BE DEFINITIVELY AND EXCLUSIVELY CORRELATED TO A SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES FOR LENS TEARS INCLUDE BOTH DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES AND POSSIBLE HANDLING ERRORS BY THE CUSTOMER. TO ADDRESS DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES, ALL STAGES IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE INJECTORS AND CARTRIDGES WERE REVIEWED AND REVISED AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WERE REVEALED. TO ADDRESS HANDLING ERRORS, ALL INJECTOR/CARTRIDGE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU) HAE BEEN MODIFIED TO ADD FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS TO INSTRUCT THE USERS IN THE PROPER DELIVERY TECHNIQUES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE, AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING THE LENS.

ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE/TIME, AFTER THE REPORTED ISSUE BEGAN, THE PT CLAIMED HE HAD A ""LOW BLOOD SUGAR"" AND EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: ""HOT, SWEATY AND SHAKY."" THE PT DENIED RECEIVING MEDICAL INTERVENTION AS A RESULT OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING WITH THE PT: TESTING FREQUENCY, DIABETES MEDICATIONS, DATE/TIME HE DEVELOPED HYPOGLYCEMIC SYMPTOMS, ANY CHANGES IN DIET, ACTIVITY, MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO DEVELOPING SYMPTOMS, AND FINALLY ACTIONS TAKEN TO TREAT SYMPTOMS. AT THE TIME OF TROUBLESHOOTING, THE CCA CONFIRMED THERE WAS NO MISUSE TO THE SUBJECT METER. THE PT HAD NOT REPLACED THE BATTERY PER THE OWNER'S BOOKLET RECOMMENDATION AND DID NOT HAVE A NEW BATTERY AT THE TIME OF THE CALL. THE ISSUE REMAINED UNRESOLVED. REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS WERE SENT TO THE PT. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE PT CLAIMS, HE WAS UNABLE TO TEST HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE DUE TO THE REPORTED ISSUE AND REPORTEDLY DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA AFTER THE ALLEGED METER ISSUE BEGAN. LIFESCAN HAS REQUESTED THE RETURN OF THE SUBJECT METER AND STRIPS FOR EVAL, BUT HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THEM.

1067644;0;"ON 29-MAY-2008, STRYKER BIOTECH RECEIVED A REPORT THAT A MALE PATIENT WHO RECEIVED OP-1 IMPLANT ON (B) (6)-2008 FOR A TIBIAL NON UNION COMPLAINED OF PAIN, REDNESS AND SWELLING AT THE WOUND SITE. THE SURGEON REPORTED THAT THE WOUND FAILED TO HEAL COMPLETELY AND THAT A SMALL ABSCESS DEVELOPED AT THE WOUND SITE. THE PATIENT WAS REOPERATED ON (DATE NOT SPECIFIED) TO REMOVE THE EXCESS FLUID AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PAIN. THE SURGEON SUSPECTS THAT SOME OF THE WHITE FLUID WHICH WAS DRAINED FROM THE ABSCESS WAS OP-1 IMPLANT. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON ANTIBIOTICS (NOS). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED 29-MAY-2008. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED 13-JUN-2008. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SWELLING, PAIN AND REDNESS AND DEVELOPED AN ABSCESS APPROXIMATELY 2 DAYS AFTER UNDERGOING A PROCEDURE FOR TIBIAL NON UNION. THE ABSCESS WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 CM IN SIZE. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THE ABSCESS MATERIAL APPEARED THINNER AND LESS VISCOUS THAN TYPICAL ABSCESS MATERIAL. A WOUND CULTURE WAS PERFORMED AND TESTED NEGATIVE FOR THE PRESENCE OF MICROORGANISMS. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD NO PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD HAVE PREDISPOSED HIM TO POOR WOUND HEALING. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON BACTRIM AND THE EVENTS ARE REPORTED AS ONGOING. THE PHYSICIAN IN THIS CASE BELIEVES THAT THE EVENTS ARE RELATED TO THE USE OF OP-1 IMPLANT. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE EVENT DESCRIBED IS AN ABSCESS. THE CULTURES WERE NEGATIVE FOR MICROORGANISMS, AND THE SECRETION APPEARED TO LESS VISCOUS THAN TYPICAL ABSCESS MATERIAL ACCORDING TO THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN. HOWEVER, THE PHYSICIAN DID USE THE TERM ""ABSCESS"" CONSEQUENTLY IN REPORTING THE EVENT THE SPONSOR HAS USED THE SAME TERM. THE DESCRIPTION OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS PROVIDED BY THE PHYSICIAN MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE AND EXCESSIVE WOUND SITE REACTION WITH DISCHARGE OF THE IMPLANTED MATERIALS. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN IF THE EVENT PROLONGED THE HOSPITALIZATION; THIS INFORMATION IS PENDING. GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE EVENT RELATIVE TO DOSING, A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP TO OP-1 IMPLANT CANNOT BE RULED OUT. HENCE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE EVENT IS NON SERIOUS, UNEXPECTED AND CAUSALLY RELATED TO OP-1 IMPLANT."
1067933;0;THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THE DEVICE WAS DISCARDED. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT REPORTED CONCURRENT FLOW. THE PRIMARY TUBING SET WAS BEING USED TO DELIVER AN UNSPECIFIED VOLUME OF AN UNSPECIFIED SOLUTION AT A KVO RATE. THE SECONDARY TUBING SET WAS CONNECTED TO THE PRIMARY TUBING SET AND WAS BEING USED FOR PIGGYBACK DELIVERY OF AN UNSPECIFIED ANTIBIOTIC AT AN APPROXIMATE RATE OF 100ML/HR. THE CUSTOMER CONTACT REPORTED THAT THE SECONDARY SOLUTION CONTAINER WAS RAISED HIGHER THAN THE PRIMARY SOLUTION CONTAINER.

THE RADIOLOGIST IMMEDIATELY NOTED THE WARNING AND CORRECTED THE DICTATION TO REFLECT PT A'S REPORT. BEFORE THE ADDENDUM COULD BE COMPLETED AND FAXED TO PT A'S OFFICE, PATIENT B'S ATTENDING PHYSICIAN NOTED THE RESULTS FOR PT A AND SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED PT B TO THE HOSP FOR TREATMENT. THE PT REC'D TWO UNSPECIFIED ANTIBIOTICS VIA IV (INTRAVENOUS). THE PT OUTCOME FOR PT B WAS NOT REPORTED. THE FACILITY (MOUNTAIN STATE HEALTH ALLIANCE) HAS A 3RD PARTY POWERSCRIBE EXTENDS SOFTWARE (V4.7) THAT RUNS UNDER CENTRICITY RA1000 WORKSTATION. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY A CHANGE/FIX WITHIN POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE, A DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME (DST) POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE PATCH. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE DST POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE PATCH, IF A RADIOLOGIST OPENED A STUDY IN PACS (PICTURE ARCHIVE AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM), DID NOT DICTATE ANYTHING ON THAT STUDY, CLOSED IT AND THEN OPENED ANOTHER STUDY, THE ""SHELL"" CREATED BY POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE WAS AUTOMATICALLY DELETED. AFTER THE DST SOFTWARE PATCH INSTALLATION, IF A RADIOLOGIST OPENED A STUDY IN PACS, DID NOT DICTATE ANYTHING ON THAT STUDY, CLOSED IT AND THEN OPENED ANOTHER STUDY, THE RADIOLOGIST GETS A MESSAGE: DO YOU WANT TO DELETE REPORT? THIS CAUSES CONFUSION AS THE RADIOLOGISTS DIDN'T KNOW WHICH REPORT THEY WERE BEING ASKED TO DELETE AND IF THEY SAID ""NO"", THE PRIOR EXAM THAT WAS OPENED, THAT POWERSCRIBE REPORT SHELL WOULD THEN BY SYNCHED WITH THE NEWLY OPENED EXAM. THIS WOULD CREATE AN INCORRECT DICTATION ON THE WRONG PT."

THE SECOND PATIENT WAS SCANNED NEARLY A YEAR PRIOR.  SINCE STAFF WERE INITIALLY UNABLE TO LOCATE THE STUDY, A REPEAT PROCEDURE WAS NECESSARY.  THE VENDOR STATES THAT THE TECHNICIAN MUST HAVE SELECTED THE WRONG PATIENT, BUT THE NUMBER OF STEPS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, ALONG WITH OTHER DETAILS, SUGGEST THIS WAS MORE LIKELY A SOFTWARE ERROR.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE SINCE IT WAS NOT A CURRENTLY SCHEDULED PATIENT.  SELECTING A PATIENT FROM MANY MONTHS PRIOR IS UNLIKELY.

1082112;0;EVAL SUMMARY: THE EVAL DID NOT CONFIRM ANY FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE DEVICE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OVERFILL DISCOVERED DURING EVAL. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE THERAPY LOG DATA, THE EVAL HAS DETERMINED THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS OVERFILL TO BE: INSUFFICIENT DRAIN AND MULTIPLE CYCLES ADVANCED TO FILL WHEN SLOW/NO FLOW CONDITION OCCURRED ABOVE THE MINIMUM DRAIN VOLUME THRESHOLD. SYSTEM ERROR 2431 WHICH WAS ENCOUNTERED WHILE OBTAINING THE ALARM LOG WAS CAUSED BY INTERMITTENT SOFTWARE OF THE DIGITAL PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD (PCB). THE SYSTEM ERROR ENCOUNTERED DURING THE EVAL WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OVERFILL FOUND DURING THE EVAL. THE DEVICE WILL BE ROUTED TO THE SVC AREA WHERE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS U16, U19, U26, U38 AND U42 ON THE DIGITAL PCB WILL BE SCRAPPED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. DURING EVAL OF A RETURNED HOMECHOICE MACHINE, A POSSIBLE OVERFILL SITUATION WAS IDENTIFIED WHICH OCCURRED IN 2008, DURING DRAIN CYCLE 5. THE PT'S ULTRAFILTRATION READING WAS 678ML INDICATING THE HOME PT (HP) DRAINED 678ML MORE THAN THEIR PROGRAMMED FILL VOLUME OF 1800ML. THIS INFO GIVES A TOTAL DRAIN VOLUME OF 2478ML (1800ML + 678ML).

1083548;1;A HOSPITAL FACILITY REPORTED ON JUNE 27, 2008, THAT A PT SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA ARRIVED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT APPROX THREE MONTHS PRIOR. THE PT HAD A MEDICATION ORDER PLACED BY A PHYSICIAN ON A CUSTOM ORDER ENTRY SCREEN AND RECEIVED A MEDICATION TO WHICH HE WAS ALLERGIC RESULTING IN AN ALLERGIC REACTION REQUIRING STANDARD TREATMENT. HE FULLY RECOVERED AND WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL WITHIN 48 HRS. THE CUSTOM ORDER ENTRY SCREEN DISPLAYED A PLACEHOLDER INDICATING NO ALLERGY INFO HAD BEEN RECORDED ON THIS VISIT. THERE WAS A HISTORICAL ALLERGY ENTRY THAT DID NOT DISPLAY ON THE CUSTOM ORDER ENTRY SCREEN, BUT DID DISPLAY ON ALL OTHER SCREENS. THE CUSTOMER ORDER ENTRY SCREEN IS INTENDED FOR ANCILLARY ORDERS (E.G., LABS, X-RAYS, NURSING ORDERS) AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE WITH MEDICATION ORDERS. THE CUSTOM ORDER ENTRY SCREEN REQUIRES A MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER (OBTAINED VIA REGISTRATION) TO DISPLAY ALLERGIES FROM PREVIOUS VISITS.
1083564;0;BAXA WAS NOTIFIED ON 06/25/2008 THAT A PATIENT HAD RECEIVED A TPN BAG CONTAINING A HIGHER-THAN-DESIRED QUANTITY OF TRACE ELEMENTS. THE BAG WAS INFUSED FOR 18 HOURS AND THEN REMOVED ONCE THE ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED. THE PATIENT'S BLOOD WORK INDICATED HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED LEVELS OF ZINC AND CHROMIUM. HOWEVER, NO ADDITIONAL MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS NEEDED. THE PATIENT IS IN STABLE CONDITION AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE SYMPTOMS AS A RESULT OF THE INFUSION. THE CUSTOMER'S SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE PHARMACIST, WHO ENTERED THE SUBJECT ORDER WITHIN THE ABACUS CALCULATING SOFTWARE, MISTAKENLY ENTERED A VALUE OF 3ML/KG OF PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS IN ADDITION TO 3ML OF ADULT TRACE ELEMENTS. THE FACILITIES PROCEDURE STATES THAT PATIENTS SHOULD RECEIVE ADULT TRACE ELEMENTS AND NO PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS. PHARMACIST VERIFICATION OF THE ORDERED INGREDIENTS FAILED TO IDENTIFY THE ADDITIONAL 84ML OF PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF BAXA TECHNICAL SUPPORT, THE IMPORTANCE OF ABACUS SOFTWARE WARNING LIMITS AND INGREDIENTS DOSING RULES WERE ADDRESSED WITH THE CUSTOMER AND A NEW CATASTROPHIC WARNING LIMIT WAS CREATED FOR PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS FOR ALL PEDIATRIC AND NEONATAL PATIENTS. THIS WARNING LIMIT WILL NOTIFY THE USER WHEN THE VALUE FOR PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS HAS EXCEEDED THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF 5ML. INVESTIGATION HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE ABACUS CALCULATING SOFTWARE PERFORMED AS DESIGNED AND DELIVERED THE VOLUME OF PEDIATRIC TRACE ELEMENTS AS ORDERED.
1083974;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PT HAD A VFIB/VTACH-LIKE RHYTHM THAT NEVER ALARMED AS VFIB, VTACH OR ASYSTOLE. STAFF DISCONNECTED THE PT FROM TELEMETRY, CONNECTED A ROVING DASH TO VERIFY DATA AT THE BEDSIDE, AND DEFIBRILLATED THE PT. NO PT INJURY REPORTED. GE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE REPORTED OCCURRENCE IS STILL ONGOING. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE ISSUED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
1084072;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE 9900 SYSTEM HAD GRAINY IMAGES. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED. A GE SERVICE REP PERFORMED AN ON SITE INVESTIGATION. THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE SYSTEM WAS IN MAG2 MODE. THE SYSTEM WAS CHANGED TO NORMAL MODE DURING THE SERVICE CALL. THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED AND FOUND TO BE WORKING AS INTENDED, AND PUT BACK INTO SERVICE.
1084426;0;"USER FACILITY WAS UNABLE TO SUPPLY THE LOT NUMBER OF THE DEVICE USED, CONSEQUENTLY, THE MFR DATE OF THE DEVICE IS UNK. THE COMPLAINANT DID NOT REPORT THE LOT NUMBER OF THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT. IN LIEU OF A REPORTED LOT NUMBER, A SHIP HISTORY REPORT (SHR) WAS PERFORMED, WHICH INDICATED THAT THE LAST THREE LOTS SHIPPED TO THIS CUSTOMER WERE 11691220, 11723037, AND 11672416. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS FOR LOT NUMBERS 11691220 AND 11723037 FOR THESE TWO LOTS SHIPPED TO THIS CUSTOMER APPEAR NORMAL AND NO QUALITY RELATED ISSUES OR MFG RELATED DEFICIENCIES WERE NOTED. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD WAS PERFORMED FOR LOT 11672416, WHICH REVEALED ONE ISSUE FOR A NON CONFORMING REPORT FOR A NON RELATED ISSUE. THE 2008 15-MONTH POLARIS W/WIRE TREND REPORT FOR ALL COMPLAINT FAILURE MODES WAS REVIEWED; NO ADVERSE TRENDS WERE NOTED. THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED FOR EVAL, AND INSPECTION OF THE UNIT WAS PERFORMED. DURING THE INSPECTION NO VISIBLE RESIDUE WAS PRESENT TO INDICATE PT USE. THE PROXIMAL CURL WAS FOUND TO BE TORN OFF, BUT WAS ALSO RETURNED FOR EVAL. THE SUTURE HAD BEEN TORN AWAY, BUT WAS NOT RETURNED. THE PROXIMAL SIDEPORT WAS ALSO FOUND TO HAVE BEEN TORN. THE VISUAL EVAL FOUND THAT THE STENT HAS BEEN TORN IN TWO. THE TEAR WAS JAGGED AND ANGLED ACROSS THE BODY OF THE STENT AND WAS FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 4.7 CENTIMETERS FROM THE PROXIMAL END OF THE DEVICE. A SECOND TEAR WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED. THIS TEAR WAS ALSO JAGGED, AND WAS FOUND TO BE APPROX 6 MILLIMETERS LONG. A FUNCTIONAL EVAL WAS THEN PERFORMED, WHICH FOUND THAT A 0.038 INCH GUIDE WAS COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THROUGH THE REMNANTS OF THE DEVICE WITHOUT ISSUE. IN CONCLUSION, THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT OF THE STENT BEING BROKEN AND DETACHED HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS FAILURE IS THAT DURING THE CLINICIAN'S REMOVAL OF THE SUTURE FROM THE STENT, THE STENT WAS TORN IN TWO WITH THE SUTURE. THE EVAL OF THE DEVICE SUGGESTS THAT THE SUTURE WAS GRABBED AND PULLED, AND THAT MOST LIKELY WITH THE SUTURE WRAPPED AROUND THE BODY OF THE STENT, WHICH CAUSED THE SUTURE TO TEAR THROUGH THE STENT BODY. THE SUTURE WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE TORN FROM THE PROXIMAL SIDE-PORT THROUGH THE STENT MATERIAL TO THE PROXIMAL END OF THE DEVICE. THE COMPLAINANT REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS PREPARING THE DEVICE FOR A THERAPEUTIC IMPLANT IN A PT, BUT FOUND THAT THE PROXIMAL PIGTAIL HAD BECOME DETACHED AFTER REMOVAL OF THE SUTURE FROM THE STENT. THE CLINICIAN THEN OBTAINED ANOTHER OF THE SAME DEVICE AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE PT PROCEDURE. THE COMPLAINT REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE PT AS A RESULT OF THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION."
1085033;1;DEVICE FAILURE SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

1085040;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WOULD BE RETURNED. THE SITE DID NOT MAKE ANY ALLEGATIONS ON THE SYSTEM. IT WAS JUST AN EXTRA ONE THAT THEY HAD. HOWEVER, THE HANDHELD WOULD NOT TURN ON; EVEN WHEN IT WAS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL BY THE CYBERONICS' REPRESENTATIVE. THE POWER LIGHT DID NOT ILLUMINATE EITHER. PRODUCT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE PROGRAMMING WAND. IT PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS AND NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING ON THE HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE. DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."
1085052;1;"PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM: PROBLEM: DURING IN-HOUSE TESTING, AN ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED IN BLOOD ORDER PROCESSING (BOP/BOPW) WHEN AT LEAST TWO TESTS ARE ADDED TO A UNIT IN THE COMPATIBILITY TESTING WINDOW; THE FIRST TEST IS RESULTED AND THEN DELETED WITHIN THE SAME ENTRY SESSION.

THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING COMPLETED AS PART OF A CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN PURSUANT TO AN FDA INSPECTION CONDUCTED AT THE FACILITY IN APRIL 2008. NON-SUPPORTED SPECIAL CHARACTERS WERE USED IN DDP NAMES. UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD USED SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN THE DESCRIPTIONS AND DDP NAMES, WHICH IS NOT SUPPORTED IN PACS. THIS ISSUE CAN CAUSE USER CREATED DDPS TO FAIL AND THEN REVERT BACK TO GE DDP. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN A USER IS VIEWING AN EXAMINATION OF A PACS (PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM) WORKSTATION, THE USER'S PERSONAL DDP (DEFAULT DISPLAY PROTOCOL AN AUTOMATIC WAY THE IMAGES ARE DISPLAYED WHEN THE EXAM OPENS), AND THE CUSTOMER (SITE) DDP FAILS TO AUTO DISPLAY, THE SYSTEM REVERTS BACK TO GE DDP WITHOUT NOTICE. THE USER MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXAM ORDER HAS CHANGED, CAUSING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE OLD EXAM IS THE NEW ONE AND VICE VERSA. THIS COULD CAUSE THE RADIOLOGIST TO BELIEVE PATIENT PATHOLOGY HAS GOTTEN BETTER OR WORSE THAN IS TRUE, IF THEY DO NOT REVIEW THE DATE STAMP IN THE TITLE BAR. THE GE DDP IS SET TO DISPLAY THE CURRENT EXAM ON THE RIGHT MONITOR AND THE PREVIOUS OR HISTORICAL EXAM ON THE LEFT MONITOR. IT WAS REPORTED THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION, A PATIENT UNDERWENT UNNECESSARY SURGERY.
1085370;1;IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CUSTOMER INSTALLED CONFIGURATION DID NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS IMAGE DISPLAY REDUNDANCY. CUSTOMER COULD HAVE CONTINUED SURGERY BY: REVIEW FROM ANOTHER WORKSTATION, SENDING DIRECTLY TO VARIAN OR EXPORTING IMAGES TO CD MEDIA FOR VIEWING. DUE TO A COMMUNICATION ERROR BETWEEN THE PACS SYSTEM AND THE FACILITY'S VARIAN BRACHYVISION, A PROCEDURE HAD TO BE CANCELLED AND RESCHEDULED.

1104273;0;EIGHT MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PT WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSP DUE TO AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS CONDUCTED AND THROMBUS WAS OBSERVED INSIDE THE IMPLANTED CYPHER STENT PROXIMALLY. TO TREAT THE THROMBUS, BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS CONDUCTED. PHYSICIAN'S COMMENT: THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS THE STENT WAS UNDER-DILATED. IN 2005, THE PT HAD A STENT ELECTIVELY IMPLANTED. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A BALLOON AT 8 ATM AND A 2.5 X 23MM CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED AT 12 ATM. THE RESIDUAL % OF STENOSIS WAS 0. THE TARGET LESION WAS A DE NOVO, CONCENTRIC CHRONIC TOTALLY OCCLUDED, TYPE C DISTAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX. THE LESION LENGTH WAS LESS THAN 20MM AND THE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.5MM. A REPORT REC'D FROM AN AFFILIATE INDICATED THAT A PT EXPERIENCED A VERY LATE THROMBOTIC EVENT AFTER HAVING A CORONARY ARTERY STENT IMPLANTED. THE PT'S MEDICAL HISTORY IS SIGNIFICANT FOR MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA, HYPERTENSION, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, AND PRIOR PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION. THE INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE IS UNKNOWN. THE TARGET VESSEL WAS AHA13, THE DISTAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (CFX). THE LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS A DE NOVO CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION OF UNDETERMINED TIME. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A 2.5MM X 20MM BALLOON AT 8 ATMS FOLLOWED BY A 2.5MM X 23MM CYPHER STENT AT 12 ATMS. THE STENT WAS NOT POST-DILATED AND THE RESIDUAL PERCENT OF STENOSIS WAS REPORTED AS 0%. IVUS WAS NOT CONDUCTED. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT ANTIPLATELET REGIMEN WAS PRESCRIBED FOR THE PT AT DISCHARGE. APPROXIMATELY TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER, THE PT WAS ADMITTED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED AND REVEALED THROMBUS INSIDE THE CYPHER STENT AND PROXIMAL ASPIRATION OF POBA WERE CONDUCTED TO TREAT THE THROMBUS. PHYSICIAN'S COMMENT: THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE THROMBOTIC EVENT WAS THAT THE STENT WAS UNDER-DILATED. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW WAS PERFORMED AND SHOWED THAT THIS LOT OF PRODUCTS MET ALL REQUIREMENTS PER THE APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING QUALITY PLAN. THROMBOTIC EVENTS ARE A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLANTING CORONARY ARTERY STENTS. WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE INFO, OTHER THAN THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT FACTORS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. THIS CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENT IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES CYPHER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING CORONARY STENTS.
1104377;0;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND IF RECEIVED, WILL BE PROVIDED ON A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. SAME PATIENT EVENT AS MDR 8031020-2008-00064. THE NURSE, REPORTED THAT THE TIP OF THE PRODUCT BROKE DURING THE IMPLANTATION. THEN THE TIP OF THE THREADED GUIDE WIRE BROKE TOO. THE BROKEN PARTS STAYED IN THE PATIENT BONE.
1104417;0;THE EVENT WAS REPORTED THAT A PATIENT UNDERWENT A GYNECOLOGICAL PROCEDURE ON AN UNKNOWN DATE. DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE LIGHTS ON THE MOTOR DRIVE UNIT WERE FLASHING WHEN GRABBING TISSUE. THE SURGEON TRIED A SECOND HAND PIECE, AND ENCOUNTERED RESISTANCE REMOVING THE HAND PIECE FROM THE MOTOR DRIVE UNIT. THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH THE SECOND HAND PIECE, WITH NO ADVERSE PATIENT CONSEQUENCES. CONCLUSIONS: THE ACTUAL DEVICE INVOLVED IN THIS EVENT WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE REPORTED SYMPTOM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE EVALUATION WAS ABLE TO INSERT AND REMOVE A DISPOSABLE HAND PIECE WITHOUT RESISTANCE. THE BLADE WOULD SPIN WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AND THE ALIGNMENT OF THE COUPLER TO THE CPC CONNECTOR WAS VERIFIED AS GOOD. IN ADDITION, A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE MANUFACTURING RECORDS WAS CONDUCTED, AND THE DEVICE MET ALL FINISHED GOODS RELEASE CRITERIA.
1104666;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SURGEON INSERTED A CC4204BF COLLAMER PLATE LENS AND THE LENS CRACKED UPON INSERTION. THE LENS WAS REMOVED WITHOUT ANY PATIENT INJURY. EVAL: RESULTS: VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED PRODUCT SHOWED THAT THE OPTIC WAS TORN AND THERE WAS A CLEAR SURGICAL RESIDUE ON THE LENS. CONCLUSION: AN INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED TO EVALUATE A COMPLAINT TREND ASSOCIATED WITH LENS TEARS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED IN 2005. THE DAMAGE TO THE LENS, AS OBSERVED AND PHOTOGRAPHED UPON THE RETURN OF THE LENS TO STAAR, CAN NOT BE DEFINITIVELY AND EXCLUSIVELY CORRELATED TO A SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES FOR LENS TEARS INCLUDE BOTH DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES AND POSSIBLE HANDLING ERRORS BY THE CUSTOMER. TO ADDRESS DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES, ALL STAGES IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE INJECTORS AND CARTRIDGES WERE REVIEWED AND REVISED AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WERE REVEALED. TO ADDRESS HANDLING ERRORS, ALL INJECTOR/CARTRIDGE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU) HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO ADD FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS TO INSTRUCT THE USERS IN THE PROPER DELIVERY TECHNIQUES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE, AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING THE LENS.

1106566;0;AS REPORTED TO AGA MEDICAL, DURING AN ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD) CLOSURE, THE AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER DETACHED FROM THE SCREW HUB/DELIVERY CABLE WITHIN THE SHEATH. A PORTION OF THE DEVICE WAS IN THE SHEATH (CONNECTING WAIST AND RIGHT ATRIAL DISC) WHILE THE LEFT ATRIAL DISC WAS OUTSIDE THE SHEATH. AFTER REATTACHING THE DEVICE TO THE DELIVERY CABLE AND RETRACTING THE DEVICE INTO THE SHEATH, IT AGAIN BECAME DETACHED AND HAD TO BE REATTACHED BEFORE WITHDRAWING IT FROM THE SHEATH. BECAUSE IT BECAME DETACHED A SECOND TIME, THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THE THREADS ON THE RIGHT ATRIAL SIDE OF THE DEVICE WERE POTENTIALLY STRIPPED, SO A DIFFERENT DEVICE WAS SELECTED. A 16MM AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER WAS UTILIZED BUT ENDED UP BEING TOO SMALL AND REPLACED WITH A 17MM AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER WHICH WAS DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY. A SECOND 8F DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS UTILIZED TO DELIVERY THE 17MM DEVICE. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE NOTED. THE AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER WAS RECEIVED AT AGA MEDICAL IN ITS ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION. THE DEVICE WAS DECONTAMINATED, MEASURED, AND CONFIRMED TO MEET DIMENSIONAL SPECIFICATIONS. UPON RECEIPT OF THE AMPLATZER� DELIVERY SYSTEM (SHEATH, DILATOR AND DELIVERY CABLE), THE DISTAL TIP OF THE SHEATH WAS OBSERVED TO BE SLIGHTLY FLARED. VISUAL EXAMINATION PERFORMED UNDER MAGNIFICATION REVEALED NO ANOMALIES WITH THE DEVICE END SCREW. THE DELIVERY CABLE AND DEVICE END SCREW THREADS WERE EACH FOUND TO BE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS USING THREAD GAGES. THE RETURNED DEVICE WAS ATTACHED AND DETACHED WITH MINIMAL EFFORT FROM THE RETURNED DELIVERY CABLE. ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE, THE LIKELIHOOD OF REATTACHING THE DELIVERY CABLE TO THE DEVICE WITHIN THE SHEATH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. DURING MANUFACTURING, THIS DEVICE UNDERWENT A SERIES OF INSPECTIONS AND TESTS TO CONFIRM PROPER FUNCTION, INCLUDING ATTACHING AND DETACHING TO A TEST DELIVERY CABLE. REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION CONFIRMED THIS DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THESE INSPECTIONS. OUR INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PERFORMANCE DESCRIBED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AN INACCURATE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE DEVICE AND DELIVERY CABLE CAUSED THE ATTACHMENT AND DETACHMENT DIFFICULTIES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO CONFIRM THE DEVICE WAS REATTACHED TO THE DELIVERY CABLE WITHIN THE SHEATH.
1106572;1;(B) (4). (B) (4). DURING INTERNAL ROUTINE TESTING, IT WAS FOUND THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, EDITING TEXT IN THE REPORT MAY PREVENT NEW PHRASES FROM POPULATING THE REPORT. THIS OCCURS WHEN REPORT TEST IS MANUALLY MODIFIED AND ADDITIONAL PHRASES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED AS A RESULT OF WORKSHEET INTERACTIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, SOME PHRASES THAT FOLLOW IN THE SPECIFIC SECTION OF THE MANUALLY EDITED TEXT WILL NOT POPULATE THE REPORT. THIS BEHAVIOR WAS NOT REPORTED FROM A CUSTOMER SITE AND THEREFORE WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE. THIS ISSUE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE CRITICAL REPORT INFO FOR TREATMENT PLANNING IS NOT AVAILABLE IF THE REPORTING PHYSICIAN DOES NOT VERIFY THE REPORT CONTENT. A CUSTOMER SAFETY ADVISORY NOTICE WAS CREATED AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. FURTHER ON A SOFTWARE PATCH WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR UPGRADE OF THE SOFTWARE VERSION.

IF THE METER IS RETURNED, LIFESCAN WILL EVALUATE IT AND, IF THE METER DOES NOT PASS INSPECTION, LIFESCAN WILL INFORM FDA OF THE RESULTS IN A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. IN 2008, THE LAY USER/PATIENT CONTACTED LIFESCAN ALLEGING THE ONE TOUCH ULTRA LINK METER PROMPTED AN ERROR 5 MESSAGE. THE PT TOOK 18.5 UNITS OF INSULIN BASED ON A SLIDING SCALE AS A RESULT OF THE PRODUCT ISSUE. THE PT DENIED SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE PT DID NOT DEVELOP ANY SYMPTOMS. IT WAS DETERMINED DURING THE TROUBLESHOOTING TELEPHONE CALL, THE PT'S TESTING TECHNIQUE WAS CORRECT. THE TEST STRIPS WERE IN GOOD CONDITION. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE PRODUCT ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED DURING TROUBLESHOOTING. THE PT DID NOT SUFFER ANY SYMPTOMS.
1108706;0;IN 2008- REPORTER ALLEGED THAT THE INTELL DRIVE IS STUCK IN REVERSE. CUSTOMER STATED THAT WHEN THE SWITCH IS ACTIVATED THE BED GOES INTO REVERSE. NO INJURIES REPORTED AT THIS TIME. AT ABOUT FIVE DAYS LATER, TORN PUSH HANDLE COVER ON LEFT SIDE, CAUSES DRIVE SWITCH TO STAY ENGAGED AFTER USE, REPLACED DAMAGED PUSH HANDLE.
1109223;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE 9900 SYSTEM WOULD NOT RETRIEVE IMAGES FROM PACS. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED. A GE SERVICE REP PERFORMED AN ON SITE INVESTIGATION.

CALCULATION CANNOT BE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE MEAN AND CONFIDENT LIMIT SINCE THE CUSTOMER DID NOT PROVIDE EXACT LAB TESTING RESULTS. THE CUSTOMER HAS SAID >5.0 FOR THE LAB RESULTS WHEN CALLED IN. REPEATED TESTING FOR THE PATIENT #2 ARE AS FOLLOWS IN INRATIO: 1ST DAY 1.5; 2ND DAY 2.6; 3RD DAY 3.6; AVERAGE: 2.57%; SD 1.05%, CV% 40.9%. THE %CV IS GREATER THAN 20% AND CRITERIA IS NOT MET AS PER INTERNAL PROCEDURE, SO FUNCTIONAL TESTING WILL BE PERFORMED AS PART OF THE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION. PRODUCT WILL BE INVESTIGATED. ALL THE REPEATED TESTING WERE NOT DONE WITHIN THREE HOURS TIMINGS AS REQUIRED BY INTERNAL PROCEDURE. THEREFORE THERE IS HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT DISCREPANCIES ARE DUE TO CHANGE IN THE STATUS OF THE PATIENT. THEREFORE IMPRECISION TESTING WILL NOT BE REQUIRED. THE CALLER ALLEGED DISCREPANT RESULTS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE LAB RESULTS AND ALSO ALLEGED DISCREPANT RESULTS WHEN REPEATED TEST WITH INRATIO. THE DISCREPANT RESULTS WHEN COMPARED WITH LAB RESULTS IS AS FOLLOWS: DATE: 2008. INRATIO: 1.5. LAB >5.0. REPEATED TESTING FOR THE PATIENT #2.

1111827;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN A RADIOLOGIST WAS DICTATING A PT REPORT USING POWERSCRIBE EXTENDS SOFTWARE, DICTATION WAS ENTERED FOR PT B WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERED FOR PT A. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE REPORT WAS STOPPED BEFORE REACHING THE PHYSICIAN, AND NO TREATMENT WAS PERFORMED ON THE INCORRECT PT. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE FACILITY (B)(6) HAD A 3RD PARTY POWERSCRIBE EXTENDS SOFTWARE (V4.7) THAT RUNS UNDER CENTRICITY WORKSTATION. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY A CHANGE/FIX WITHIN POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE, A DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME (DST) POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE PATCH. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE DST POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE PATCH, IF A RADIOLOGIST OPENED A STUDY IN PACS (PICTURE ARCHIVE AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM), DID NOT DICTATE ANYTHING ON THAT STUDY, CLOSED IT AND THEN OPENED ANOTHER STUDY, THE ""SHELL"" CREATED BY POWERSCRIBE SOFTWARE WAS AUTOMATICALLY DELETED. AFTER THE DST SOFTWARE PATCH INSTALLATION, IF A RADIOLOGIST OPENED A STUDY IN PACS, DID NOT DICTATE ANYTHING ON THAT STUDY, CLOSED IT AND THEN OPENED ANOTHER STUDY, THE RADIOLOGIST GETS A MESSAGE: DO YOU WANT TO DELETE REPORT? THIS CAUSES CONFUSION AS THE RADIOLOGISTS DIDN'T KNOW WHICH REPORT THEY WERE BEING ASKED TO DELETE AND IF THEY SAID ""NO"", THE PRIOR EXAM THAT WAS OPENED, THAT POWERSCRIBE REPORT SHELL WOULD THEN BE SYNCHED WITH THE NEWLY OPENED EXAM. THIS WOULD CREATE AN INCORRECT DICTATION ON THE WRONG PT."

THE BATTERY WAS CHANGED IN THE WAND AND THE HANDHELDS WERE CHARGED. THE HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE WERE RETURNED FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD AND THE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEFECTIVE SERIAL CABLE. CONTINUITY TESTING IDENTIFIED A BROKEN ORANGE WIRE (CLEAR TO SEND). NOTED AS AN OPEN CONDUCTOR IN HANDHELD SERIAL DATA CABLE; FOLLOWING REPLACEMENT WITH A KNOWN GOOD CABLE, FULL PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY WAS RESTORED. NO FURTHER ANOMALIES ON THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE AND NO SOFTWARE ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD WERE IDENTIFIED. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."

1111890;0;THE RESPIRATORY THERAPY (RT) TEAM LEADER REPORTED THE PATIENT WAS IN THE ER ON A MONITOR. THE MONITORING INDICATED THE PATIENT'S OXYGEN SATURATION WAS DECREASING. IT WAS UNKNOWN WHAT LEVEL THE OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED TO. NURSING RESPONDED TO THE PATIENT AND REPORTED THE PATIENT WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE PATIENT CIRCUIT, AND THERE WAS NO ALARM EMITTED FROM THE VENTILATOR. HOSPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT REPORTED THE HOSPITAL INCIDENT REPORT INDICATED BOTH NURSE AND MD RESPONDED TO THE PATIENT AND THERE WAS NO VENTILATOR ALARM DURING DISCONNECT. THE PATIENT WAS BAGGED WHICH BROUGHT THE OXYGEN SATURATION BACK UP TO 100% AND PUT THE PATIENT ON ANOTHER VENTILATOR. AN HME WAS BEING USED INLINE WITH THE PATIENT CIRCUIT. THE VENTILATOR SETTING FOR THE LOW INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (LIP) ALARM WAS UNKNOWN. THE PATIENT SUFFERED NO PERMANENT HARM OR IMPAIRMENT. MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE TECHNICIAN PERFORMED EVALUATION AND TESTING OF UNIT. DURING EVALUATION AND TESTING THE VENTILATOR FUNCTIONED TO SPECIFICATIONS, INCLUDING ALARMS. RISK MANAGEMENT WAS INFORMED OF THE REPORTED HME INLINE, AND THAT THE HOSPITAL STAFF MUST BE AWARE OF SETTING VENTILATOR ALARMS APPROPRIATELY FOR EACH PATIENT, AND THAT THE LIP ALARM SHOULD BE TESTED WHEN THE VENTILATOR IS USED ON A PATIENT, ESPECIALLY WITH OTHER DEVICES PLACED INLINE IN THE PATIENT CIRCUIT. IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT IF THE LIP ALARM WASN'T SET PROPERLY, AND THE HME OR SOME OTHER OBSTRUCTION SUCH AS THE PATIENT OR BEDDING, ETC. WAS GOOD TO INCREASE THE GAS FLOW RESISTANCE AND KEEP THE VENTILATOR PRESSURE ABOVE THE LIP SETTING THAT THE LIP ALARM WOULD NOT ACTIVATE.

THE COMPLAINT WAS CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE CUSTOMER CARE ADVOCATE'S (CCA) DOCUMENTATION. THE PATIENT STATED THAT THE ALLEGED ISSUE BEGAN ON TWO DAYS EARLIER AT 11:30PM DURING THAT TIME, THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY OBTAINED INACCURATE HIGH READINGS ON THE SUBJECT METER. AT AN UNSPECIFIED TIME, PATIENT REPORTEDLY OBTAINED THE READINGS OF ""215, 233, 249MG/DL"" ON THE SUBJECT METER AND COMPARED WITH AVIVA METER (NON-LFS METER) READINGS OF ""192 NAD 210MG/DL"", PERFORMED IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES OF EACH OTHER. BASED ON THE STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY, THE CALCULATED DIFFERENCE OF THESE GLUCOSE RESULTS WERE WITHIN THE EXPECTED VALUE OF <= 30% AND /OR <=30MG/DL. THE PATIENT STATED THAT AS A RESULT OF THE HIGH READINGS OBTAINED ON THE SUBJECT METER, HE REPORTEDLY TOOK AN ADDITIONAL 6 UNITS OF NOVOLOG INSULIN. AS A RESULT, IN LESS THAN 2 HOURS, THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY EXPERIENCED SYMPTOMS OF ""SHAKINESS AND SWEATINESS."" THE PATIENT DID NOT SEEK ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) AND DID NOT REQUIRE/ RECEIVE ANY OTHER TREATMENT FOR THE DIABETES. DURING THE TROUBLESHOOTING, THE CCA NOTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS OBTAINING BLOOD SAMPLES FROM HIS FINGERS. THE PATIENT'S TESTING TECHNIQUE WHEN REVIEWED WAS FOUND TO BE CORRECT AND HE WAS ALSO CLEANING THE PUNCTURE AREA PROPERLY. THE METER WAS SET TO THE CORRECT UNIT OF MEASUREMENT AND THE REPORTED RESULTS (215, 233, 249MG/DL) WERE VERIFIED IN THE SUBJECT METER'S MEMORY. REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS WERE SENT TO THE PATIENT. BASED ON THE PROVIDED INFORMATION, THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE PATIENT ALLEGEDLY DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA, AFTER HE REPORTEDLY TOOK ADDITIONAL UNITS OF INSULIN BASED ON THE ALLEGED READINGS.

1118706;0;A MALE PT UNDERWENT AAA REPAIR IN 2008. THE MAIN BODY GRAFT AND TWO ILIAC LEG GRAFTS WERE PLACED WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS. THE ZENITH WAS PLACED WITHIN AN HOUR OF CUT DOWN. ON THE FINAL RUN, THE PHYSICIAN NOTED A POSSIBLE PROXIMAL TYPE I ENDOLEAK. THE INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST ON STAFF WAS CALLED IN AND HE STATED THAT HE THOUGHT THERE MAY BE A TEAR IN THE MAIN BODY GRAFT. WITH LATERAL VIEWS, HE DECIDED THAT WAS INCORRECT SO DETERMINED IT MIGHT BE A TYPE I ENDOLEAK BUT WAS UNSURE. THE PHYSICIAN WAS THEN PLACING A MAIN BODY EXTENSION AND ACCIDENTALLY PARTIALLY DEPLOYED THE CUFF. HE WAS THEN ABLE TO PARTIALLY RESHEATH ENOUGH OF THE CUFF TO MOVE IT PROXIMALLY OUT OF THE ILIAC LEG GRAFT AND PAST THE MAIN BODY'S BIFURCATION INTO THE MAIN BODY STENT. BALLOONING WAS THEN DONE AND ON THE FINAL RUN THE WHOLE GRAFT WAS FLOWING WITHOUT ANY ENDOLEAKS. THE PHYSICIAN WAS CONCERNED WITH THE DISFIGURED CUFF THAT IT MAY HAVE THROMBOSED THE MAIN BODY GRAFT SO DECIDED TO EXPLANT THE GRAFT ALL TOGETHER. UPON REMOVING ALL OF THE GRAFTS, ALL LOOKED NORMAL AND THE CUFF WAS BENT AND DISFIGURED AS EXPECTED DUE TO IMPROPER DEPLOYMENT PROCESS. UPON OPENING PT THE PHYSICIAN NOTED A HUGE AMOUNT OF PLAQUE AT THE BACK OF THE AORTA JUST DISTAL TO THE RENALS AS WELL AS A LARGE LUMBAR ALSO DISTAL TO THE RENALS AND A LARGE ACCESSORY RENAL. THE GRAFT WAS RECEIVED IN A USED CONDITION, ALONG WITH TWO LEG EXTENSIONS. AN INSPECTION OF THE MAIN BODY GRAFT COULD NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF A TEAR IN THE GRAFT. AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO REASONS TO BELIEVE THE DEVICE WAS NOT MANUFACTURED TO CURRENT COOK INCORPORATED SPECIFICATIONS. EACH ZENITH DEVICE IS SHIPPED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) LISTING ANATOMICAL REQUIREMENTS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, AND THE CORRECT DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE. AN INTERNAL CLINICAL REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE EVENT WAS DUE TO USER ERROR. WE HAVE NOTIFIED THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR SIMILAR EVENTS.

1119286;1;DEVICE FROM RESERVE SAMPLE EVALUATED. THE PROBLEM WAS REPORTED FROM A CUSTOMER WHO WAS COMPARING MEASUREMENT DATA PROVIDED BY ISITE IN CORRELATION TO A KNOWN OBJECT. IN THIS EVENT ISITE REPORTED DIMENSIONAL DISCREPANCIES IN THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF 1.5 X AND 2X. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE FUJI MODALITY WAS SENDING DICOM MEASUREMENT (B) (4), (B) (4) IN LIEU OF (B) (4), (B) (4), WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED BY ISITE. THE ISITE DICOM CONFORMANCE STATEMENT CLAIMS COMPLIANCE TO DICOM V. 3.0 FOR WHICH ISITE PACS 4.1 WAS DEVELOPED UNDER DICOM 3.0 RELEASE 2003. DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2003 TO 2008, DICOM DID NOT SPECIFY THE USE OF (B) (4), (B) (4) AND RECOMMENDED THE USE OF (B) (4), (B) (4). IN 2006, DICOM PUBLISHED A STATEMENT WHICH WARNED AGAINST THE USE OF (B) (4), (B) (4). THE ISITE PACS IFU STATES THAT MEASUREMENTS TAKEN USING ISITE ARE FOR REFERENCE ONLY AND THAT IF PRECISE MEASUREMENTS ARE REQUIRED THEN THE OPERATOR IS INSTRUCTED TO CALIBRATE ISITE USING A KNOWN FIDUCIARY. IN THE 2008 RELEASE OF DICOM V. 3.0, THE (B) (4), (B) (4) IS SPECIFIED FOR USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH (B) (4), (B) (4). THE POTENTIAL FOR FAILURE IS THE UNDERLYING FACT THAT MEASUREMENT DISCREPANCIES COULD RESULT IN PATIENT MISDIAGNOSIS FOR MISTREATMENT.

1119524;0;THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS. UPON RECEIPT AND COMPLETION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE GUIDEWIRE STUCK ON THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS). TE PHYSICIAN SUCCESSFULLY PLACED A PROMUS 2.5X18MM STENT TO AN UNKNOWN LESION. UPON REMOVAL OF THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) , THE IQ GUIDEWIRE CAUGHT ON THE SDS AND STARTED COMING OUT TOO. THE PHYSICIAN WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE SDS WITH THE IQ GUIDEWIRE STILL INTACT. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO PLACE A 2.75X23MM PROMUS STENT, BUT WHILE TRYING TO PASS THROUGH THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENT, THE SDS SEEMED TO BE CAUGHT ON THE IQ GUIDEWIRE AGAIN. THE PHYSICIAN THEN REMOVED THE UNDEPLOYED STENT AND THE GUIDEWIRE. THE IQ GUIDEWIRE WAS REPLACED WITH A NON BSC GUIDEWIRE AND A 2.5X8MM NON BSC BARE METAL STENT WAS PLACED SUCCESSFULLY. NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT STATUS POST PROCEDURE IS NOTED AS OK.
1119687;1;USER EXPERIENCED ERRONEOUS URINE BUN RESULTS. ONE PATIENT SAMPLE GENERATED A RESULT OF 651 MG/DL WHICH WAS DISPLAYED ON THE DATA MONITOR, BUT A RESULTS OF 3 MG/DL WAS SENT TO THE LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE USER REPEATED THE SAMPLE AND GENERATED A RESULT OF 663 MG/DL WHICH WAS DISPLAYED ON THE DATA MONITOR, BUT A RESULT OF 3 MG/DL WAS AGAIN SENT TO THE LABORATORY INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE SAME SAMPLE REPEATED ON ANOTHER ANALYZER GENERATED A RESULTS OF 641 MG/DL. ERRONEOUS RESULT WAS REPORTED. NO INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO DETERMINE IF PATIENT WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

1120323;0;EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE DEVICE IS AN AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR, AND THE ACTUAL DEVICE INVOLVED WAS EVALUATED. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR CODE WAS DUE TO A CRACKED SOLDER JOINT ON THE PREAMP CIRCUIT BOARD, CAUSING THE LOSS OF REQUIRED SIGNALS. RESOLDERING OF THE JOINT RESOLVED THE ISSUE. ONCE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED, THE DEVICE PASSED TESTING AND RETURNED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMER STATED THE UNIT HAD A PREAMP EXT REF FAILURE. NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT.
1120604;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEVICE WOULD NOT POWER ON. THERE WAS NO PATIENT USE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. PHYSIO-CONTROL EVALUATED THE DEVICE, AND VERIFIED THE REPORTED FAILURE. PHYSIO REPLACED THE POWER PCB ASSEMBLY, AND THEN OBSERVED PROPER OPERATION THROUGH FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE TESTING. THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE CUSTOMER FOR USE. PHYSIO-CONTROL FURTHER EVALUATED THE REPLACED ASSEMBLY AND DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED FAILURE WAS A SHORTED CAPACITOR, DESIGNATOR C25, WHICH CAUSED FET TRANSISTOR, DESIGNATOR Q2, TO OVERHEAT, RESULTING IN SHORT WITHIN THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF AUX VOLTAGE TO GROUND, THEN BLOWING A FUSE, DESIGNATOR F1.

THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND IS PENDING PRODUCT ANALYSIS. CONCLUSION: DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1123811;0;THE GENERATOR WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO END OF SERVICE AND RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE END OF SERVICE CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY DURING THE ANALYSIS, THE R35 RESISTOR WAS FOUND TO BE OUT OF SPECIFICATION. THE CAGED MODULE WAS FOUND TO EXHIBIT AN OUT -OF-LIMIT (HIGH) PULSING CURRENT. ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT DURING MANUFACTURING OF THE GENERATOR, THE R35 RESISTOR (A SELECTABLE VALUE RESISTOR) COULD HAVE BEEN MORE OPTIMALLY CHOSEN. A LOWER VALUE RESISTOR WOULD HAVE MORE SUITABLY CENTERED THE CURRENTS WITHIN THEIR LIMITS. USING THE LOWER VALUE, THE CAGED MODULE MET ALL TEST SPECIFICATIONS. THE OUT-OF-LIMIT PULSING CURRENT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE END OF SERVICE CONDITION, HOWEVER, RESULTS OF THE BATTERY LONGEVITY PREDICTION CONFIRM THAT THE END OF SERVICE CONDITION WAS AN EXPECTED EVENT.
1123853;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A SITE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR HANDHELD. WHEN THE NURSE TRIED TO TURN IT ON NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. SHE ALWAYS KEEPS IT PLUGGED INTO THE WALL AND CHARGED. SHE TRIED TO TURN IT ON AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE IT TURN ON. CHECKED CONNECTIONS TO VERIFY THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. A DIFFERENT OUTLET WAS USED AND IT STILL WOULD NOT TURN ON. A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE SITE. PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING ON THE HANDHELD.

CO CORPORATION CONSIDERS THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AND NO FURTHER NARRATIVE IS REQUIRED. ADD'L MODEL: 3.5/4.0 DFU. THE ISSUE INVOLVES DRUG FORMULARY UPDATE IN MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, AND CAUSES CERTAIN MEDICATIONS TO HAVE THE INCORRECT DEFAULT AND ALTERNATE GIVE AMOUNTS AS LISTED IN SYSTEM MANAGER. THESE MEDICATIONS INCLUDE MULTI-DOSE ORAL SUSPENSIONS WITH VOLUMES OF 30 ML OR LESS FOR THE FOLLOWING MEDICATIONS: AZITHROMYCIN, OSELTAMIVIR, AND CEFTIBUTEN. IF A CLINICIAN SCANNED ON OF THESE MEDICATIONS TO ADMINISTER A DOSE, THE DOSE FIELD ON THE ADMINISTRATION DETAILS SCREEN WILL DISPLAY THE ENTIRE PACKAGE SIZE AS THE VOLUME, BUT ONLY DISPLAY THE DRUG STRENGTH AMOUNT CONTAINED IN 5 ML OF THE SUSPENSION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A 30 ML BOTTLE OF AZITHROMYCIN 200 MG/5 ML IS SCANNED, THE ADMINISTRATION DETAILS SCREEN WILL DISPLAY 200 MG AS THE DOSE AMOUNT AND DOSE UNITS AND 30 ML AS THE VOLUME AMOUNT AND VOLUME UNITS. THE VOLUME TO ADMINISTER FOR A 200 MG DOSE IS INCORRECT AND, IF THE DOSE IS CHANGED BY THE CLINICIAN, THE INCORRECT VOLUME WOULD BE CALCULATED FOR THE NEW DOSE AMOUNT. PT CARE MAY BE AFFECTED AS CLINICAL DECISIONS COULD BE BASED ON INAPPROPRIATE INFO. THIS ISSUE COULD MISLEAD THE CLINICIAN IN DETERMINING THE CORRECT VOLUME TO ADMINISTER TO OBTAIN THE ORDERED DOSE. IN ADDITION, THIS ISSUE COULD LEAD TO THE INCORRECT DOCUMENTATION OF THE DOSE ON THE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORD (MAR). CO HAS RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF A PT EVENT AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE 2008, WHERE AN ADULT PT RECEIVED 1200 MG AZITHROMYCIN INSTEAD OF THE 250 MG ORDERED BY THE CLINICIAN.

THE ONLY RESULTS PENDING WHERE THE EXTRA TESTS THAT THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE PERFORMED. IT APPEARED THAT WHEN A BARCODE WAS READ, THE SAMPLE ID WAS BEING EDITED AND THE 10-DIGIT NUMBER WAS NOT ENTERED COMPLETELY. WHEN CERNER, THE COMPUTER SYSTEM PROCESSING DATA, SAW 6 DIGITS INSTEAD OF 10, IT FILLED IN THE FRONT NUMBERS USING THE (B)(6) DATE, WHICH BROUGHT IT BACK TO A SPECIMEN ID ALREADY RUN AT THE OTHER SITE. THE SPECIMEN THAT SHOWED UP ON THE PENDING LIST AS (B)(4) HAD RUN AT THE OTHER SITE AS (B)(4). IT APPEARED TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE CUSTOMER'S LABORATORY INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS (LIS) FILLING IN MISSING DIGITS WITH THE (B)(6) DATE, WHICH MAY CAUSE IT TO INADVERTENTLY CREATE A DUPLICATE SPECIMEN ID. THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT SUGGESTED THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN; THE LOG FILES AND CONFIGURATION FILES FROM THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE SHOULD BE COLLECTED FROM THE CUSTOMER SOON AFTER THE EVENT HAPPENS. A PRINTOUT OF THE DATALOG AND THE SPECIMEN REPORT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL IN ORDER TO FULLY INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE. SECTION 2 OF THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE, LIST NUMBER (B)(4), PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING PROPER LIS SET UP. SECTION 5 RECOMMENDS SETTING UP A LABORATORY PROCEDURE TO REQUIRE ANY UNPROCESSED WORK LIST ENTRIES BE VIEWED AND CLEARED AT THE END OF EACH SHIFT OR DAY. USE OF THIS PROCEDURE WILL MAINTAIN AN UP-TO-DATE WORK LIST AND REDUCE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY UNPROCESSED SPECIMEN IDS, LEFT IN THE WORK LIST FOR AN EXTENDED TIME, TO BE MATCHED WITH A DIFFERENT PATIENT WITH THE SAME SPECIMEN ID. APPENDIX A PROVIDES LIST NUMBER (B)(4) FOR THE LABORATORY INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMERS TO ORDER. A REVIEW OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL COMPLAINT ANALYSIS TRENDING SYSTEM (CATS) AND TRENDING ANALYSIS SUPPORT SYSTEM (TASS) TREND ANALYSIS REPORTS ON THE (B)(4) DATABASE FOR THE MONTHS OF (B)(6) 2007 THROUGH (B)(6) 2008 HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR THE COMPLAINT ISSUE. NO ADVERSE TRENDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE INSTRUMENT, LIST NUMBER (B)(4), REGARDING THIS ISSUE. THE (B)(6) 2008 REPORT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT."

1181364;1;DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. (SEE SCANNED PAGE). REPORTER INDICATED HIS DELL X5 HANDHELD COMPUTER DID NOT HOLD ITS CHARGE AS LONG AS IT SHOULD HAVE. HE STATED THAT HE ALWAYS KEEPS IT PLUGGED IN WHEN NOT IN USE, AND WHEN HE UNPLUGS IT, IT USUALLY LASTS FOR MANY HOURS. THIS TIME, HOWEVER, IT HELD ITS CHARGE FOR LESS THAN 2 HOURS WHICH IS UNUSUAL. PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER, BUT PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING.
1181365;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT SITE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER AND THE INTERROGATING WAND. MANUFACTURER REP TESTED THE SYSTEM AND FOUND IT TO BE THE WAND THAT WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER, BUT PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING. DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1181369;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE. THE PHYSICIAN INDICATED THAT THE CONNECTION FELT REALLY LOOSE AND THE DEVICE WOULD ONLY CHARGE IF THE CORD HELD A CERTAIN WAY WHILE PLUGGED IN THE WALL. THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS HOWEVER IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT.
1181370;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY TURNING ON HIS HANDHELD DEVICE. THE HANDHELD DEVICE HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR TWO YEARS NOR WAS IT PLUGGED INTO CHARGE DURING THAT TIME. THE PHYSICIAN PLUGGED IN THE DEVICE THIRTY MINUTES PRIOR TO A PROGRAMMING SESSION HOWEVER, AFTER THAT TIME, HE WAS UNABLE TO GET THE DEVICE TO TURN ON. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD DEVICE AND WAS ASKED TO SEND THE OLD HANDHELD BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE PRODUCT RETURNED HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1181443;1;"PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM: THE FOLLOWING ISSUE IS ISOLATED TO BLOOD ORDER PROCESSING (BOP) 'ACCESSION NUMBER' LOOK-UP MODE; IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ISSUE MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED ON DEMAND. ONCE THE 'SEARCH' BUTTON IS CHOSEN FOR AN ACCESSION NUMBER, THE SYSTEM ALLOWS ENTRY OF A SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER WITHOUT FIRST CLEARING THE SEARCH RESULTS FROM THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER. THIS MAY CAUSE THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER DATA TO BE COMBINED WITH THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER ON THE SCREEN DISPLAY WHEN THE 'SELECT' BUTTON IS CHOSEN. AS A RESULT, IF DATA IS SAVED, A PT OTHER THAN THE ONE EXPECTED MAY BE UPDATED. THIS ISSUE CANNOT BE REPRODUCED ON DEMAND IN ANY OTHER BLOOD BACK AND GENERAL LABORATORY RESULTING MODULES. NO PATIENT HARM WAS REPORTED. FOR BLOOD ORDER PROCESSING (BOP), THE FOLLOWING WORKFLOW SCENARIO IS GIVEN FOR CLARITY: PREREQUISITES: MUST BE USING LOOK-UP MODE BY 'ACCESSION NUMBER' IN BOP. THE PATIENT BELONGING TO THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER HAS A HISTORICAL BLOOD TYPE ON FILE AND UNITS ALLOCATED. THE PATIENT BELONGING TO THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER HAS NO HISTORICAL BLOOD TYPE ON FILE AND NO UNITS ALLOCATED. THE FOLLOWING STEPS MAY BE USED TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE; HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ISSUE CANNOT BE REPRODUCED ON DEMAND. ENTER THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER AND 'SEARCH'. 'CANCEL' OR 'SAVE' THE ACCESSION NUMBER. THE SYSTEM RETURNS TO THE ACCESSION NUMBER LOOK-UP MODE. NOTICE THAT THE PREVIOUS ACCESSION NUMBER DISPLAYS IN BOTH LOOK-UP BOX AND THE LOOK-UP RESULT LIST. ENTER THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER IN THE LOOK-UP BOX. NOTICE THAT THE LOOK-UP BOX DISPLAYS THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER AND THE LOOK-UP RESULT LIST DISPLAYS THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER. CHOOSE THE 'SELECT' BUTTON. THIS ACTION INITIATES THE LOADING OF THE ACCESSION NUMBER DISPLAYED IN THE LOOK-UP RESULT LIST (ACCESSION NUMBER ONE). WHILE THE ACCESSION NUMBER IS LOADING, CHOOSE THE 'SEARCH' BUTTON. THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER WILL REPLACE THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER IN THE LOOK-UP RESULT LIST. THE SYSTEM WILL NOW ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER WHILE THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER IS ALSO LOADING. WHEN BOP FINISHES LOADING, PATIENT TESTING AND UNIT TESTING DATA FROM THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER ARE DISPLAYED, HOWEVER, THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER'S PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS ARE DISPLAYED IN THE PATIENT RIBBON. CHOOSE 'SAVE', THE UNITS FROM THE FIRST ACCESSION NUMBER WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE SECOND ACCESSION NUMBER. THE SYSTEM NOW UPDATES THE BLOOD BANK ADMINISTRATIVE DATA (BAD) FILE OF THE PATIENT ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESSION NUMBER TWO WITH THE BLOOD TYPE OF THE PATIENT FROM ACCESSION NUMBER ONE. NOTE: IF THE PATIENT ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESSION NUMBER TWO HAD A HISTORICAL BLOOD TYPE OR ANTIGEN/ANTIBODY PREVIOUSLY ON FILE, QUALITY ASSURANCE FAILURES FOR BLOOD TYPE AND ANTIGEN/ANTIBODY COMPATIBILITY WOULD OCCUR AT ALLOCATION (BOP) AND ISSUE (BPI) THUS PREVENTING AN INCOMPLETE UNIT FROM BEING ISSUED."
1181589;1;(SEE SCANNED PAGE). REPORTER INDICATED A VNS DELL X5 HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD RESOLVED THE SCREEN FREEZING. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FOR RETURN BUT HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE.
1181592;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS DELL X50 HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT PERFORMING AS INTENDED. THE COMPUTER WAS ALSO NOT CHARGED PER THE REPORTER. THE REPORTER WAS ADVISED TO FULLY CHARGE THE COMPUTER BEFORE THE NEXT USE. ATTEMPTS TO THE REPORTER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE COMPUTER WAS WORKING PROPERLY AFTER CHARGING HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. CONCLUSIONS: DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1181593;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR HANDHELD WAS NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR AND WAS FREEZING UPON INTERROGATION. THE HANDHELD CONTAINED 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE HANDHELD WAS UNPLUGGED AND THE AFTER A FLASHCARD REINSERTION WITH SOFT RESET THE PATIENT WAS REINTERROGATED SUCCESSFULLY.
1181595;1;ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED FLASHCARD REVEALED SQL ERRORS FOLLOWING AN INTERROGATION ATTEMPT, MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF POWER OR REMOVAL OF THE FLASHCARD DURING COMMUNICATION ATTEMPTS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE SQL ERROR MESSAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CORRUPT CYBERONICSBU.CDB DATABASE. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE DATABASE CORRUPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER TO THE HANDHELD DURING USAGE. ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT SEVERAL ARCHIVE DATABASES WERE CORRUPT. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE CORRUPTIONS IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED.
1181596;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NURSE WAS RECEIVING A ""NEW APPLICATION NOT INSTALLED"" ERROR MESSAGE WHEN SHE TRIED TO USE THE HANDHELD. SHE WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE THROUGH ROUTINE TROUBLESHOOTING. THE HANDHELD DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS AND NO ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE EVALUATION PROCESS. AS A RESULT, NO LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED CONDITION COULD BE DETERMINED."
1181597;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN HAD DIFFICULTY INTERROGATING THE PT'S DEVICE DURING A ROUTINE PROGRAMMING SESSION. THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING AND WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE SITE HAS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WHEN THEY USED THE SAME WAND WITH DIFFERENT HANDHELD DEVICES ON VARIOUS PTS. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFO AND PRODUCT FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.

A RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT WHEN SHE OPENED AN EXAM FOR REVIEW IN THE DICTATE OF THE EXAM NOTE WAS NOT FOR THE PT EXAM SHE HAD OPENED. THE EXAM NOTE WAS FROM A PT THAT SHE HAD IN HER OPEN EXAM LIST BUT WAS NOT CURRENTLY BEING VIEWED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS ISSUE OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INCIDENTS.
1182314;1;"A FOLLOW UP MDR WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT FLUORO GRAPHIC OVERLAYS WERE UNABLE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE RA1000 WORKSTATION AFTER THE PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM (PACS) WORKSTATIONS WERE UPGRADED FROM 2.1 TO 3.0.2.1. IT WAS REPORTED THE ORIGINAL OVERLAY GRAPHIC MARKER PUT ON BY THE RADIOGRAPHER AT THE TIME OF THE SCAN WOULD NORMALLY BE PLACED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE IMAGE. ""R"" WOULD DENOTE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PT AND ""L"" WOULD DENOTE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SIDE OF THE PT. THE FLUORO GRAPHIC EXAM IN THEIR CURRENT VERSION OF 3.0.2.1 DID NOT DISPLAY THE MARKER. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH THE RIGHT OR LEFT SIDE OF THE IMAGE."
1182990;0;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE SYSTEM WAS DISPLAYING A COMMUNICATION FAILED ERROR MESSAGES. THE SYSTEM DID NOT HARM THE PT. THE WORKSTATION POWER SUPPLY WAS WITHIN ITS VOLTAGE SPECIFICATION. THE GE SERVICE REP REPLACED THE SBC CPU BOARD AND VERIFIED THE C-ARM FOR PROPER OPERATION BY REBOOTING 20 TIMES AND USING THE C-ARM. DURING THE COURSE OF THIS REPAIR, HE FOUND A PROBLEM WITH THE IMAGES BEING MIXED UP BETWEEN THE THUMBNAILS AND THE IMAGES, SO ANOTHER CASE WAS OPENED. SYSTEM OPERATES AS INTENDED.

THE PHYSICIAN TRIED REGISTERING THE MAIN CORINA FROM EVERY ANGLE AND THE RESULTING MESSAGE WAS A CONTINUED SUGGESTION TO RE-REGISTER THE MAIN CORINA, RESULTS VARIED FROM 7.8-10.2. AFTER TRYING TO RE-REGISTER ALL 6 POINTS IT WAS DECIDED TO DELETE ALL THE POINTS AND START OVER. THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PHYSICIAN TO COMPUTE A NEW DIVERGENCE SCORE WHEN ALL THE POINTS WERE DELETED AND THEN RE-REGISTERED, THEREFORE, THEY HAD TO RESTART THE SYSTEM. IT WAS DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD AT 7.8. AND THE PHYSICIAN MATCHED UP THE LOCATABLE GUIDE (LG) WITH THE MAIN CORINA TO START THE CASE AND THE LOCATABLE GUIDE LINED UP WITH THE MAIN CORINA EXCEPT IN THE SAGITAL VIEW WHERE THE LOCATABLE GUIDE WAS PARTIALLY OUT OF THE AIRWAY. THE PHYSICIAN TRIED TO NAVIGATE TO THE LESION AND IT WAS VERY APPARENT THE LOCATABLE GUIDE WAS OUT OF THE AIRWAY. THEREFORE, THE CASE WAS NOT COMPLETED WITH THE SYSTEM, INSTEAD FLUOROSCOPY WAS USED AND BIOPSIES WERE TAKEN. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.
1185057;0;THE COMPLAINT OF A BREAK IN THE RETENTION DOME IS CONFIRMED, USER RELATED. UPON RECEIPT, A PARTIAL SEMI-CIRCULAR BREAK IN THE RETENTION DOME WAS OBSERVED. A SMALL SECTION OF THE BROKEN DOME IS STILL ATTACHED TO THE FEEDING TUBE AND REVEALS A COMPLETE BOND. MATING THE BROKEN RETENTION DOME TO HE FEEDING TUBE SHOWED A CLOSE MATCH. THE DULL AND ROUNDED VENEER IDENTIFIED AT THE DOME SITE ARE TRAITS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE THAT WAS APPLIED DURING THE REMOVAL OF THIS DEVICE. THE LACK OF ANY ASSOCIATED DAMAGE SUGGESTS THE TEAR IN THE DOME WAS CAUSED BY STRETCHING THE DOME MATERIAL BEYOND ITS ELASTIC LIMITS DURING REMOVAL. THE COMPLAINANT INDICATES THE COMPLAINT SAMPLE HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR APPROX 179 DAYS PRIOR TO THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. GROSS VISUAL AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF A DEFECT OR DEFORMITY RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

1190330;0;THE PATIENT'S HISTORY IS SIGNIFICANT FOR HYPERLIPIDEMIA, HYPERTENSION, PREVIOUS CORONARY BYPASS SURGERY (1992), MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, AND MODERATE TO SEVERE RENAL DISEASE. THE PATIENT WAS ON CLOPIDOGREL, ANTICOAGULANTS WITH AN INR OF 2, STATINS, AND ACE INHIBITORS. THE INDICATION FOR THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS STABLE ANGINA PECTORIS. INTRA- PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS CONSISTED OF A LOADING DOSE OF CLOPIDOGREL 600MG, AND UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN. THE ANGIOGRAM SHOWED TWO-VESSEL DISEASE, BUT ONLY THE MID (LAD) LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY WAS TREATED. THE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.5MM AND THE LESION LENGTH WAS 30MM. THE LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS DE NOVO, NON-OSTIAL , TYPE C, AND 95% STENOSED. A 6FRENCH-GUIDING CATHETER WAS UTILIZED TO CANNULATE THE VESSEL, AND THE LESION WAS DIRECT STENTED WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF TWO CYPHER SELECT PLUS (2.5X13MM AND 2.5X23MM) STENTS AT 15 ATMOSPHERES. AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED HOME WITH CLOPIDOGREL, ANTICOAGULANTS WITH AN INR OF TWO, AND STATINS. THIS PRODUCT IS SIMILAR TO US CYPHER. THIS IS ONE OF THREE PRODUCTS INVOLVED WITH THIS PRODUCT MALFUNCTION, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH MFG REPORT # 9616099-2008-02389. A REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE STUDY FOR SUBJECT INDICATED THAT THIS PATIENT WAS ADMITTED WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA, APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTH AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA, NO MARKER ELEVATION. THE ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWS A TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE CYPHER STENTS PLACED IN THE MILD (LAD) LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. A (PCI) PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PLACEMENT OF A 3X12MM ENDEAVOR STENT. THE EVENT WAS HIGHLY PROBABLE TO THE DEVICE AND INDEX PROCEDURE. THE EVENT RESOLVED WITHOUT SEQUEL.

THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS WERE DUE TO THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS (RVS) SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS' MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STATIC CHARGE VARIATION ACROSS RV LOTS. OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT CAN GENERATE A STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS INCLUDE LOW HUMIDITY, HANDLING, SHIPPING AND CREATION OF CHARGE WITHIN THE ARCHITECT INSTRUMENTS THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION, ABBOTT HAS IMPLEMENTED STATIC CHARGE TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL INCOMING RV LOTS FROM OUR SUPPLIER. ABBOTT HAS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY OF INCOMING RESIN MATERIAL, AND TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLIER'S MOLDING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL GENERATION OF STATIC CHARGE. A REVIEW OF THE ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL FOUND SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON HOW TO RECOVER FROM ERROR CODES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE. END OF REPORT. (B)(4). THIS COMPLAINT IS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH CORRECTION AND REMOVAL NUMBER 1415939-2/27/09-003-R. THE INITIAL MDR WAS FILED AGAINST THE ARCHITECT I2000SR ANALYZER, LIST NUMBER 3M74-02, MANUFACTURING SITE, (B)(4). UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSATIVE AGENT FOR THIS ISSUE IS THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS. AN INVESTIGATION IS STILL IN PROGRESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. ARCHITECT STAT TROPONIN-I ASSAY LN: 2K41-01 LOT#: UNK. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT.  A FINAL REPORT WILL BE ISSUED AT THE CONCLUSION OF AN INVESTIGATION. (B)(4), ADVERSE EVENT OR PRODUCT PROBLEM:UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THIS COMPLAINT, THE EVENT DESCRIBED DOES NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENT, AS THERE WAS NO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY REPORTED BY THE COMPLAINANT.CONCOMITANT MEDICAL PRODUCTS:ARCHITECT I2000 ANALYZER, LIST # 3M74-02, (B)(4).EVALUATION: AS NO METHOD, RESULTS OR CONCLUSIONS CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME.UPON FURTHER REVIEW, THE CUSTOMER ISSUE IS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIAL ACTION REPORTING NUMBER 1415939-2/27/09-003-R, AS THE LOT OF THE SUSPECT REACTION VESSEL WAS IN USE AT THE CUSTOMER FACILITY.   AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS.  A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). ARCHITECT (B)(4) ANALYZER LIST#:3M74-02 (B)(4); ARCHITECT STAT TROPONIN-I ASSAY LN: 2K41-01 LOT#: NI. THE INITIAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED UNDER BRAND NAME ABBOTT ARCHITECT (B)(4) ANALYZER, IRVING TX MANUFACTURING SITE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE PERFORMED ON BRAND NAME ARCHITECT REACTION VESSEL, ABBOTT (B)(4) MANUFACTURING SITE. A COMPLAINT ANALYSIS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF COMPLAINTS RELATED TO ERROR CODE 1006, (UNABLE TO PROCESS TEST, BACKGROUND READ FAILURE), ERROR CODE 1007, (UNABLE TO PROCESS TEST, ACTIVATED READ FAILURE), AND INCORRECTLY ELEVATED PATIENT RESULTS. THE READ VALIDITY CHECKS THAT RESULT IN AN ERROR CODE 1006/1007 MONITOR SEVERAL TYPES OF READ ANOMALIES, OF WHICH, ELEVATED RELATIVE LIGHT UNITS (RLU) SPIKES POTENTIALLY DUE TO STATIC DISCHARGE ARE INCLUDED. DETAILED REVIEW OF EACH OCCURRENCE IS NEEDED TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR. THIS TYPE OF DATA ANALYSIS IS UNDERWAY AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. THERE IS NO ANALYTICAL IMPACT FOR THOSE SAMPLES WHERE ERROR CODES 1006, UNABLE TO PROCESS TEST, BACKGROUND READ FAILURE OR 1007, UNABLE TO PROCESS TESTS, ACTIVATED READ FAILURE, OCCURS BECAUSE THE CORRESPONDING TEST GOES TO EXCEPTION AND NO RESULTS ARE REPORTED. FOR THOSE STATIC DISCHARGES THAT OCCUR DURING THE CHEMILUMINESCENT REACTION, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR FALSELY ELEVATED RESULTS. BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION TO DATE, REACTION VESSEL (RV) LOTS MADE FROM A PARTICULAR POLYPROPYLENE RESIN LOT ARE A PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS. MEASUREMENT OF THE ELECTRICAL CHARGE IMPARTED ON UNUSED RVS SHOWED A STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN RV LOT MADE FROM THIS RESIN LOT COMPARED TO RV LOTS MADE FROM DIFFERENT RESIN LOTS. REPLACEMENT RVS USE DIFFERENT RESIN LOTS, BUT STILL COULD EXHIBIT STATIC DISCHARGE AS WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED CAUSE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE MODES OF CONTROL WHILE THE INVESTIGATION PROCEEDS. CORRECTIVE AND/OR PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WILL ALSO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION. THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURIES OF MAJOR SEVERITY REPORTED FOR THIS ISSUE FROM ANY ARCHITECT CUSTOMERS. THIS IS AN SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS STILL IN PROGRESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT ONE PATIENT GENERATED AN INITIAL ARCHITECT STAT TROPONIN-I ASSAY RESULT OF 0.134 NG/ML. THE RESULT WAS REPORTED AND QUESTIONED BY THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN AS THERE WAS NO CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF A HEART ATTACK. THE SAMPLE RETESTED AT 0.04 NG/ML.  THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR OBSERVATION BASED ON THE INITIAL RESULT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SERIOUS INJURY OR INTERVENTION TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY. IN TOTAL, TEN PATIENT SAMPLES GENERATED ELEVATED TROPONIN-I RESULTS THAT RETESTED AT LOWER VALUES. IN NO CASE WAS ANY INVASIVE TREATMENT PERFORMED ON ANY OF THE PATIENTS. THE CUSTOMER ONLY PROVIDED THE RESULTS OF ONE PATIENT'S HOSPITALIZATION AS AN EXAMPLE. THERE IS NO FURTHER IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED. (B)(4). ARCHITECT I2000SR ANALYZER, LIST # 3M74-02, (B)(4). THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS WERE DUE TO THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS (RVS) SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED RV LOTS MADE FROM A PARTICULAR POLYPROPYLENE RESIN LOT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS. ANALYSIS OF THIS RESIN LOT DETERMINED IT HAS UNIQUE COMPOSITIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER RESIN LOTS, WHICH FACILITATED THE BUILD-UP OF STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION ALSO IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS' MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STATIC CHARGE VARIATION ACROSS RV LOTS. THE LATEST INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ABBOTT HAS IMPLEMENTED MORE STRINGENT STATIC CHARGE SAMPLING AND TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL INCOMING RV LOTS FROM OUR SUPPLIER. ABBOTT HAS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY OF INCOMING RESIN MATERIAL, AND TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLIER'S MOLDING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL GENERATION OF STATIC CHARGE. (B)(4). UPON FURTHER REVIEW THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIAL ACTION REPORTING NUMBER 1415939-02/27/09-003-R. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT EXPERIENCED INCREASE IN SPASTICITY OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. CONTRAST STUDY FINDINGS: UNABLE TO ASPIRATE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID FROM THE PUMP RESERVOIR AND CONTRAST DID NOT FLOW INTO THE THECAL SAC. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH A 'PUMP MALFUNCTION WHICH WAS CAUSING THE RECURRENT SYMPTOMS'. THE PT WAS ADMITTED IN 2009 FOR PUMP REPLACEMENT. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE CATHETER PROXIMAL TO THE ANCHOR AND THE CATHETER WAS REMOVED. THE FASCIA WAS OPENED TO IDENTIFY THE REMAINDER OF THE CATHETER BUT IT WAS NOT EASILY FOUND. IT WAS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE OLD CATHETER IN PLACE AND IMPLANT A NEW CATHETER. THERE WERE NO OPERATIVE COMPLICATION; THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL. ADDITIONAL INFO FROM THE USER FACILITY: PT WITH HISTORY OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, AND LOWER EXTREMITY SPASTICITY UNDERWENT PLACEMENT OF AN INTRATHECAL (BACLOFEN) PUMP SEVEN MONTHS PRIOR TO REPLACEMENT. RECENT INCREASE IN SPASTICITY OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. STUDY FINDINGS: INABILITY TO ASPIRATE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID FROM THE PUMP RESERVOIR AND CONTRAST DID NOT FLOW INTO THE THECAL SAC. FINDINGS WERE CONSISTENT WITH A PUMP MALFUNCTION WHICH WAS CAUSING THE RECURRENT SYMPTOMS. PT ADMITTED ON EVENT DATE FOR PUMP REPLACEMENT. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: BREAKAGE IN CATHETER PROXIMAL TO THE ANCHOR AND THE CATHETER WAS REMOVED. THE FASCIA WAS OPENED TO IDENTIFY THE REMAINDER OF THE CATHETER BUT IT WAS NOT EASILY FOUND. IT WAS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE OLD CATHETER IN PLACE AND PLACE A NEW CATHETER. NO OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS AND THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL."
1194065;0;PATIENT WAS REVISED TO ADDRESS PAIN. THE STEM WAS LOOSE. EXAMINATION WAS NOT POSSIBLE, AS THE DEVICES WERE NOT RETURNED. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS WAS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE AS THE PRODUCT AND LOT CODES WERE UNAVAILABLE. THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT VERIFY OR IDENTIFY ANY EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT CONTRIBUTION/ERROR WITH REGARD TO THE REPORTED EVENT WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION, THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION IS NOT INDICATED. DEPUY CONSIDERS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSED AT THIS TIME. SHOULD THE PRODUCT AND/OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BE RECEIVED TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE PERFORMED INVESTIGATION, THE COMPLAINT WILL BE RE-OPENED.
1194593;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CENTRICITY WEB (CWEB) EXPERIENCED A FORCED LOG OUT WHILE BEING USED IN A SURGICAL THEATER. THE FORCED LOG OUT OCCURRED DUE TO A DEFECT CREATING THE CWEB FORCE OUT, RATHER THAN CWEB SESSION ENDING AT A USER PRE-SET TIME. CENTRICITY WEB IS INTENDED FOR IMAGE REVIEW AND NOT FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE.
1194831;0;THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED, FOUND TO BE OPERATING AS INTENDED, AND RELEASED TO THE CUSTOMER FOR USE. THE CUSTOMER REPORTS THAT THE LOW MA AND FILAMENT SELECT ERRORS ON THE C-ARM. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED.
1196375;0;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THE PATIENT WITH THIS IMPLANTABLE RIGHT ATRIAL (RA) LEAD WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE. THE FLUID IN THE PERICARDIAL SAC WAS DRAINED, AND THE PATIENT RETURNED HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE RA LEAD WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE TAMPONADE. THE PATIENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED.
1196507;0;A SIEMENS FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) WAS SENT TO THE CUSTOMER SITE. ANALYSIS OF THE INSTRUMENT AND INSTRUMENT DATA INDICATE THAT THE ACID PUMP WAS NOT PUMPING IN THE DIAGNOSTICS MODE. THE FSE REPLACED THE ACID PUMP, HOWEVER, THE FSE DOES NOT KNOW IF THE ACID PUMP WAS THE CAUSE FOR THE DISCREPANT RESULT. THE INSTRUMENT IS PERFORMING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. NO FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE IS REQUIRED. A NEGATIVE ADVIA CENTAUR TOTAL THCG RESULT WAS OBTAINED ON A PT SAMPLE. THE RESULT WAS WITHIN THE CUSTOMER'S RANGE TO RERUN SAMPLE SO THE SAMPLE WAS RERUN AND A POSITIVE RESULT WAS OBTAINED. PT TREATMENT WAS NOT PRESCRIBED OR ALTERED. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES DUE TO THE FALSE NEGATIVE THCG RESULT.
1196750;0;CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT, AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. THE DEVICE WILL BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS AND FURTHER INFORMATION WILL FOLLOW ONCE THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THE RESERVOIR LEAKED INSULIN INTO THE RESERVOIR COMPARTMENT OF THE INSULIN PUMP. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED.
1196972;1;DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD WAS UNPLUGGED FROM THE WALL AFTER BEING FULLY CHARGED BUT COULD NOT BE TURNED ON. THE USER WAS UNABLE TO TURN IT ON, EVEN WHEN PLUGGED IN TO THE WALL. PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD.

1197223;0;"INFORMATION IS UNAVAILABLE; DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY, DURING INSERTION OF THE PRIMARY PORT WITHOUT INSUFFLATION, INJURY OCCURRED TO THE ILIAC ARTERY. A THORACIC SURGEON WAS CALLED IN AND WORKED ON THE PATIENT FOR 2 HOURS. PATIENT EXPIRED. ACCORDING TO THE SAFETY REVIEW OFFICER, SHE DID NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE A SURGEON ISSUE. SHE DID, HOWEVER, REQUEST AN INSERVICE; THE REP PROVIDED AN INSERVICE. THE STATUS OF THE TROCAR IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME."
1197575;0;CUSTOMER REPORTEDLY RECEIVED RESULTS OF 333 MG/DL AND 142 MG/DL WITHIN 10 MINUTES ON THE COMPACT PLUS SYSTEM. NO ACTIONS TAKEN BASED ON DEVICE RESULTS. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. REQUESTED RETURN OF SUSPECT DEVICE AND REPLACEMENT WAS SENT.
1197622;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS EXPERIENCING AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH HIS HANDHELD DEVICE SCREEN FREEZING. THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED A SOFT RESET WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO HAVE TO HANDHELD DEVICE RETURNED TO CYBERONICS, INC. FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1197669;0;THE FACILITY, REPORTED TO SMITHS MEDICAL THAT THERE WAS A SHORT ARTERIAL BLEED. THE FEMALE CHILD HAD A LOSS OF ABOUT 10-15 ML. THEREFORE THE CHILD RECEIVED A TRANSFUSION DUE TO ACUTE ANEMIA. LOT 1245681 MANUFACTURED 11/2007. ADD'L LOT#1283893 MANUFACTURED 03/2008, EXP DATE 03/2013. THE SUBASSEMBLY IN QUESTION IS MANUFACTURED BY SMITHS MEDICAL. THIS ASSEMBLY IS INCORPORATED INTO THE FINISHED PRODUCT BY SMITHS MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. THE FINISHED PRODUCT IS FURTHER ASSEMBLED, PACKAGED AND STERILIZED BY SMITHS MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL. ONE SAMPLE WAS RECEIVED WITH THE TUBING SEPARATED FROM THE SAMPLING SITE. EXAMINATION OF THE POINT OF DISCONNECTION SHOWED THAT SOLVENT HAD BEEN APPLIED AND THAT THE TUBING HAD BEEN FULLY SEATED IN THE CONNECTOR. THE TUBING DIAMETER WAS WITHIN SPECIFICATION. THE SOLVENT RING APPEARED LIGHT, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE AMOUNT OF SOLVENT APPLIED WAS INSUFFICIENT FOR AN ADEQUATE BOND. FULL OPERATOR RETRAINING ON SOLVENT BONDING PROCEDURES WAS COMPLETED IN 2008. THE SUB-ASSEMBLIES IN QUESTION WERE MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO THIS CORRECTION. THE DEVICE HISTORY WAS REVIEWED WITH NO ISSUE NOTED. SMITHS WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THE ISSUE AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE. CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS ADDRESSED. NO ADDITIONAL ACTION IS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME. SMITHS CONSIDERS THIS MDR CLOSED WITH THIS REPORT.
1197755;1;DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. REPORTER INDICATED A VNS HANDHELD PROGRAMMING COMPUTER WOULD NOT POWER ON. SHE STATED THE POWER LIGHT WAS NOT ON AND THE HANDHELD WAS PLUGGED INTO A WORKING OUTLET. ADDITIONALLY, SHE STATED THE POWER CORD DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LOOSE AT THE CONNECTION SITE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFO HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1197852;0;"REPORTER INDICATED A VNS PT UNDERWENT GENERATOR DUE TO END OF SERVICE. THE GENERATOR WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR AND THE REPORTED CONDITION OF THE END OF SVC (EOS) WAS DUPLICATED IN THE LAB. THE PULSE GENERATOR WOULD NOT INTERROGATE; THEREFORE, WAS OPENED. THE MEASURED BATTERY VOLTAGE OF 1.440V IS BELOW THE 2.2V LOW BATTERY OPERATION LEVEL SPECIFIED FOR THE PULSE GENERATOR PER SPEC, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE PULSE GENERATOR HAD REACHED THE END OF SVC. THE SUPPLY CURRENT PULSING 193.798UA (LIMITS ARE 80UA - 140UA) AND SUPPLY CURRENT 1MA 159.714UA (LIMITS ARE 25UA - 80UA) DID NOT MEET SPEC. THESE MEASUREMENTS DEMONSTRATE AN INCREASED CURRENT CONSUMPTION FOR THE DEVICE, RESULTING IN A PREMATURE END OF LIFE CONDITION. WITH THE CAPACITOR SUBSTITUTION FOR C6, THE MODULE MEETS POST-BURN ELECTRICAL TEST; THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE PREMATURE END OF LIFE CONDITION WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE A LEAKY CAPACITOR, C6."
1197853;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD TURN ON AND THE SCREEN WOULD GO BLANK. THE HANDHELD WAS TURNED ON AGAIN AND A RESET WAS PERFORMED BUT THE SCREEN WOULD GO BLANK AGAIN. CHANGING THE BATTERIES IN THE HANDHELD DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD WAS REPLACED WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUES. THE RETURN OF THE HANDHELD FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1197935;0;A 28 MM DIAMETER X 16 MM DIAMETER X 13.5 CM LENGTH ANEURX BIFURCATED STENT GRAFT WAS SELECTED FOR USE IN A PT FOR THE TREATMENT OF AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS POSITIONED AT THE INTENDED LANDING ZONE, IT WAS NOTICED UNDER FLUOROSCOPY THAT THE STENT GRAFT LENGTH WAS SHORTER THAN THE LENGTH ON THE PRODUCT LABEL. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS REMOVED FROM THE PT AND THE CASE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER ANEURX BIFURCATED STENT GRAFT. OUTSIDE THE PT THE STENT GRAFT LENGTH WAS MEASURED AND WAS FOUND TO BE 8.5 CM. EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE STENT GRAFT WERE RETURNED AND CONFIRMED TO BE SHORTER THAN THE DIMENSION ON THE LABEL. THE LABELED 8.5 CM ILIAC WAS LOCATED AT MEDTRONIC'S WAREHOUSE. THE DEVICE WAS DEPLOYED AND WAS FOUND TO BE THE 28 MM X 16 MM 13.5 CM BIFURCATED ANEURX STENT GRAFT. THIS EVENT WAS REPORTED TO THE CENTER FOR DEVICE AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH IN A DEVICE DEFECT REPORT DATED SEPTEMBER 17TH 2008. NO OTHER DEVICES WERE IDENTIFIED TO HAVE HAD A PROBLEM.
1197937;0;EVAL SUMMARY: MEDTRONIC HAS RECEIVED THE DEVICE AND ITS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE DISTAL SHAFT WAS KINKED 13.5 CM PROXIMAL TO THE BALLOON WELD. THE BALLOON HAD BEEN INFLATED. THE DISTAL TIP WAS FLARED. NEGATIVE PURGE CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF A LEAK. A TEAR WAS LOCATED OVER THE DISTAL END OF THE DISTAL MARKER BAND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BALLOON FOLD. COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE FIELD CONFIRMED THAT NEGATIVE PREP AND A VISUAL INSPECTION WERE COMPLETED PRIOR TO USE OF THE DEVICE WITH NO ISSUES NOTED. RESISTANCE WAS ENCOUNTERED ADVANCING THE DEVICE TO THE LESION SITE. THE LEAK WAS DETECTED WHEN INFLATION WAS FIRST ATTEMPTED AND THE BALLOON FAILED TO HOLD PRESSURE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEVICE (LOT NUMBER 0000582669) IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. A 2.0 MM X 12 MM SPRINTER RX DILATATION BALLOON CATHETER WAS INSERTED TO PRE-DILATE AN UNK LESION. VESSEL MORPHOLOGY WAS NOT REPORTED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE BALLOON WAS ADVANCED TO THE INTENDED LESION SITE AND UPON THE FIRST INFLATION, THE BALLOON WOULD NOT INFLATE. THE BALLOON WAS SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED FROM THE PT. THE PT CONDITION IS REPORTED TO BE GOOD.
1198388;1;REFERENCE MDR NUMBER 1644487-2008-02341. PRODUCT RETURNED WITH A HANDHELD AND PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. PRODUCT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED PROGRAMMING WAND. THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, WHICH PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS, HAD AN INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR AND THE RETURNED BATTERY WAS DEPLETED. A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE AND THE BATTERY WERE SUBSTITUTED. ALL COMMUNICATIONS ERRORS CLEARED. ROOT CAUSE FOR A COMPLAINT ALLEGING A NON-FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING WAND IS THE DEPLETED BATTERY. THIS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO USER OVERSIGHT OR POSSIBLY NOT KNOWING THAT THE BATTERY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ON OCCASION. AFTER THE SERIAL DATA CABLE AND THE BATTERY WERE SUBSTITUTED, PASSING FUNCTIONAL TEST RESULTS VERIFIED CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION OF THE WAND. AFTER THE SERIAL DATA CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED, THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS ELECTRICALLY TESTED AND WAS OPERATING WITHIN THE DESIGNED LIMITS OF THE FINAL ELECTRICAL TEST REQUIREMENTS. NO VISUAL ANOMALY WAS IDENTIFIED. CONTINUITY TESTING OF THE BATTERY CABLE PASSED. DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1198392;1;"REPORTER INDICATED THAT HIS (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS CONTINUOUSLY FREEZING ON THE ""INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL"" SCREEN. HE SAID THE SCREEN WOULD STAY THERE AND WOULD NOT CHANGE UNTIL HE RESET THE DEVICE. HE ALSO REPORTED THAT THIS EVENT HAS HAPPENED BETWEEN 15-20 TIMES RECENTLY AND NOW THE DEVICE WILL NOT RESTART. PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO MFR, BUT PRODUCT ANALYSIS IS PENDING."
1198394;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WILL WORK AS LONG AS IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL, BUT WILL NOT HOLD A CHARGE WHEN UNPLUGGED.

1198454;0;(SEE SCANNED PAGE). IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT COULD NOT ADJUST HER STIMULATION AND THE DEVICE COULD NOT BE INTERROGATED. IT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING AND THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED A RETURN OF SYMPTOMS. THE PHYSICIAN QUESTIONED BATTERY FAILURE. THE DEVICE WAS REPLACED. NO SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED.
1198490;0;"AFTER SUCCESSFULLY STENTING A SLIGHTLY CALCIFIED, SLIGHTLY TORTUOUS, 90% STENOSED PROXIMAL LAD VIA A RADIAL APPROACH, DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED DURING ATTEMPTS TO WITHDRAW THE SDS CATHETER. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE SDS BALLOON BECAME STUCK INSIDE OF THE IMPLANTED STENT, OR IF THE SDS BECAME STUCK ON THE HYDROPHILLIC GUIDEWIRE; OR IF BOTH ISSUES OCCURRED. INITIALLY, IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE BALLOON WAS STUCK INSIDE THE DEPLOYED STENT, SO THE PHYSICIAN INFLATED AND DEFLATED THE BALLOON SEVERAL TIMES, AND THE SDS WAS SAID TO HAVE MOVED SLIGHTLY. THE SDS WAS THEN NOTED TO BECOME STUCK ON THE TGV FLOPPY GUIDEWIRE, AND COULD NOT BE WITHDRAWN INTO THE GUIDING CATHETER. THEREFORE, THE PHYSICIAN REMOVED THE CYPHER WITH THE GUIDEWIRE AS ONE UNIT, AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED. THE GUIDEWIRE WAS ULTIMATELY REMOVED FROM THE SDS WITH SOME RESISTANCE OUTSIDE THE PATIENT. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT THE ISSUE MIGHT BE WITH THE GUIDEWIRE EXIT PORT ON THE SDS. THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING; HOWEVER, THE ENGINEERING EVALUATION HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE SUBMITTED WITHIN 30 DAY OF RECEIPT. THIS PRODUCT IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, BUT IS SIMILAR TO US DISTRIBUTED STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM."
1198694;0;IT WAS REPORTED TO MANUFACTURER THAT THE VNS PATIENT HAD THE GENERATOR REPLACED DUE TO END OF SERVICE. THE EXPLANTED GENERATOR WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. THE END OF SERVICE CONDITION WAS DUPLICATED DURING THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, THE DEVICE DID NOT MEET THE FINAL SUPPLY CURRENT SPECIFICATIONS. THE MEASURED CURRENTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASED CURRENT CONSUMPTION OF THE DEVICE, RESULTING IN A PRE-MATURE END OF LIFE CONDITION. ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE C6 CAPACITOR PRODUCED LEAKAGE CURRENT. AS A RESULT, THE LEAKY C6 CAPACITOR WAS FOUND TO BE THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE PRE-MATURE END OF LIFE CONDITION.
1198890;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHILE PLACING A BRAVO PH MONITOR, THE CAPSULE WOULD NOT ATTACH TO THE PATIENT'S ESOPHAGUS. THE CAPSULE FELL OFF IN THE PATIENT'S MOUTH. NO INJURY TO THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED. FINAL DEVICE ANALYSIS WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT. A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE SENT WHEN THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE AND/OR WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED FROM THE HCP.
1199277;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS HOSPITALIZED DUE TO HYPERGLYCEMIA AND CHEST DISCOMFORT. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, AND THE INSULIN PUMP WAS PROGRAMMED CORRECTLY. THE PRIME AND HIGH PRESSURE TESTS PASSED. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED.

1200105;0;WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE DEVICE FOR EXAMINATION, BUT THUS FAR HAVE MET WITH NO SUCCESS. WE ALSO REQUESTED PHOTOGRAPHS, BUT HAVE NOT YET OBTAINED ANY. THIS IS THE ONLY COMPLAINT OF THIS TYPE THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE CPAP DEVICE. THE DEVICE HAS A PERMANENTLY ATTACHED POWER CORD, WHICH IS SECURELY CLAMPED JUST INSIDE THE MAIN ENCLOSURE. THE WIRES ARE FIXED TO THE PCB VIA A SCREW TERMINAL BLOCK. THE PVC FLEXIBLE CORD IS APPROVED. THE ENCLOSURE IS CONSTRUCTED OF FLAME RETARDANT MATERIALS RATED TO UL 94 V-0. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL CONTINUE IN OUR EFFORTS TO RETRIEVE THE DEVICE AND WILL THEN PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR INVESTIGATION. A HEALTHCARE FACILITY REPORTED THAT A PT STATED THAT WHEN HE WENT TO BED, HE SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING, THEN THE AREA WHERE THE POWER CORD ATTACHES TO HIS CPAP HUMIDIFIER SPARKED AND CAUGHT FIRE. THE PT PUT THE FIRE OUT. THERE WAS NO PT INJURY.
1200195;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CENTRICITY WEB EXPERIENCED A FORCED LOG OUT MIDWAY THROUGH A SURGICAL PROCEDURE WHERE THE SURGEON WAS RELYING ON THE CWEB IMAGES TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED WITH THE PROCEDURE. THE APPROXIMATE TIME OF THE DELAY WAS REPORTED TO BE 8 MINUTES. THE FORCED LOG OUT OCCURRED DUE TO A BUG CREATING THE CWEB FORCE OUT, RATHER THAN CWEB SESSION ENDING AT A PRESET TIME. CENTRICITY WEB IS INTENDED FOR IMAGE REVIEW AND NOT FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE.
1201857;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A XIVE IMPLANT CAUSED PARTIAL PARAESTHESIA. AS A RESULT, THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED TWO WEEKS AFTER PLACEMENT. THE PATIENT HAD NOT REGAINED FEELING AS OF THE LAST COMMUNICATION WITH THE DOCTOR, WHO INDICATED THAT THE SYMPTOMS COULD TAKE 4-6 MONTHS TO RECOVER. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE IMPLANT INVOLVED MALFUNCTIONED. HOWEVER, THIS EVENT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR REPORTABILITY PER 21 CFR PART 803 DUE TO THE FACT THAT INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED AND BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF BODY FUNCTION RESULTED. THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION, THOUGH RESULTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AS OF THIS REPORT. EVALUATION RESULTS WILL BE SUBMITTED AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.

THE MEDICAL AFFAIRS SPECIALIST (MAS) WAS ABLE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE PT BY TELEPHONE ON OCTOBER 15, 2008 AND CLASSIFIED THE COMPLAINT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING INFO RECEIVED FROM THE CUSTOMER. THE PT TESTS HER BLOOD GLUCOSE 3 TIMES A DAY AND SHE MANAGES HER DIABETES VIA 70/30 NOVOLIN INSULIN 8 UNITS AT NIGHT, ON A SLIDING SCALE BASED ON THE METER READING. THE PT'S DAUGHTER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED ISSUE BEGAN IN 2008. DURING THAT TIME, THE PT REPORTEDLY OBTAINED AN ""INACCURATE HIGH"" READING OF ""471 MG/DL"" ON THE SUBJECT METER. BEFORE THE REPORTED ISSUE BEGAN, AT AN UNK TIME, THE PT REPORTEDLY WAS ""INCOHERENT, CONFUSED AND SHE DID NOT KNEW WHERE SHE WAS ""AND IT WAS DURING THAT TIME, THE PT REPORTEDLY OBTAINED A READING OF ""471 MG/DL"" ON THE SUBJECT METER. THE PT REPORTEDLY TOOK ADD'L 5 UNITS OF 70/30 NOVOLIN INSULIN, FOLLOWING THE REPORTED ISSUE. THE PT'S DAUGHTER REPORTEDLY DOES NOT REMEMBER THE READINGS OBTAINED ON THE SUBJECT METER PRIOR TO THE READING OF ""471 MG/DL."" SHE STATED THAT AT THE SAME TIME HER MOTHER OBTAINED A READING OF ""471 MG/DL"", ANOTHER READING OF ""118 MG/DL"" WAS OBTAINED ON THE BACK UP (CONTOUR) METER. THE PT'S USUAL READINGS WERE ""LOW"" (UNK) ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER. THE PT DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO HER DIABETIC REGIMEN/DIET/EXERCISE PRIOR TO THE REPORTED SYMPTOMS AND READINGS. THE REPORTER STATED THAT DUE TO THE REPORTED SYMPTOMS SHE HAD TO CALL THE AMBULANCE AT AROUND 11:30 PM ON THE SAME DAY. THE PT REPORTEDLY RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM THE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND OBTAINED A READING OF ""60 MG/DL"" ON THE EMT METER. THE PT REPORTEDLY WAS TREATED WITH IV GLUCOSE. DURING THE TROUBLESHOOTING, THE CCA NOTED THAT THE PT WAS OBTAINING BLOOD SAMPLES FROM HER FINGERS. THE PT'S TESTING TECHNIQUE WAS REVIEWED TO BE CORRECT AND SHE WAS ALSO CLEANING THE PUNCTURE AREA PROPERLY. THE METER WAS SET TO THE CORRECT UNIT OF MEASUREMENT. THE REPORTED RESULT WAS VERIFIED IN THE SUBJECT METER'S MEMORY. HOWEVER, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE TEST STRIPS WERE STORED OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE AND THE TEST STRIPS WERE NOT IN GOOD CONDITION. REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS WERE SENT TO THE PT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE INDICATIVE OF A METER MALFUNCTION BECAUSE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE TEST STRIPS WERE NOT STORED PROPERLY (USER ERROR), WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ALLEGED READING. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE AFTER THE REPORTED ISSUE, SHE REPORTEDLY RECEIVED ASSISTANCE FROM THE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WAS TREATED WITH IV GLUCOSE, WHICH COULD BE SUGGESTIVE THAT THE PT MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED A HYPOGLYCEMIC EPISODE. LIFESCAN HAS REQUESTED THE RETURN OF THE SUBJECT METER AND STRIPS FOR EVALUATION, BUT HAS NOT RECEIVED THEM.

1203770;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LSH PROCEDURE, THE BLADE BROKE AND FELL INTO THE PT. IT WAS RETRIEVED. THIS OCCURRED WITH THREE DEVICES. NEW DEVICE TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. THE PT IS CURRENTLY STABLE. EVAL SUMMARY: THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE DEVICES WERE RETURNED WITH THE DISTAL TIP OF THE BLADE BROKEN OFF. THE REMAINING BLADE PORTION WAS SCRATCHED. DEVICE C ALSO HAD THE CLAMP ARM DETACHED. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF BLADE DAMAGE INCLUDING BREAKAGE, ARE EXTERNAL CONTACT DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE, BLADE CONTACT WITH OTHER DEVICES, STAPLES OR CLIPS DURING THE PROCEDURE OR USING ANY MEANS OTHER THAN THE BLADE WRENCH TO ATTACH OR DETACH THE BLADE. ONCE MINOR BLADE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED, SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATIONS MAY INCREASE DAMAGE SEVERITY AND RESULT IN BLADE ""LOCKOUT"" LATER IN THE PROCEDURE, AND CONTINUED USAGE CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN BLADE. EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT, AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT THIS PROCESS.

1205690;1;THE ISSUE INVOLVES THE ENTERPRISE MASTER PERSON INDEX (EMPI) FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN CERNER MILLENNIUM FOREIGN SYSTEM INTERFACES (FSI) AND AFFECTS SITES THAT HAVE THE BY FEED EMPI RECONCILE TURNED ON. WHEN AN INVALID CONTRIBUTOR SYSTEM IS INACTIVATED, A USER HAS THE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE THE SYSTEM INTEGRATION MANAGER (SI_MANAGER.EXE) WARNINGS AND MANUALLY REACTIVATE THE CONTRIBUTOR SYSTEM. SYSTEM INTEGRATION MANAGER UPDATES THE END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM WHEN AN INVALID CONTRIBUTOR SYSTEM IS INACTIVATED. IF THE CONTRIBUTOR SYSTEM IS MANUALLY REACTIVATED, THE END_EFFECTIVE_DT_TM IS NOT UPDATED AGAIN. THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE IS THAT A COMBINE OCCURS FOR PATIENTS THAT SHOULD NOT OCCUR. MULTIPLE PATIENTS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE SAME IDENTIFIERS ARE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE PATIENT. THIS COULD RESULT IN PATIENT'S PREVIOUS CLINICAL EVENTS AND DOCUMENTED OBSERVATIONS AND ORDERS NOT BEING AVAILABLE FOR ELECTRONIC DECISION SUPPORT. ADDITIONALLY, INACCURATE INFORMATION COULD COMBINE INTO A DISASSOCIATED PATIENT RECORD. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF AN ADVERSE PATIENT EVENT AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. CERNER HAS DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION OCTOBER 10, 2008 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES. THE SOFTWARE NOTIFICATION INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND A QUERY THAT CLIENTS MAY USE TO DETERMINE IF SITES ARE AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE. A SOFTWARE MODIFICATION IS BEING DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR ALL SITES THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED. CERNER CORP. WILL PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WHEN THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION IS AVAILABLE.
1205715;0;THE INCIDENT DEVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND IS UNDER EVALUATION. WHEN THE DEVICE EVALUATION IS COMPLETE, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED OF THE SITE, BUT NO OTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AS TO DEGREE OF BURN OR CURRENT PATIENT STATUS. THE REPORT STATED THAT DURING A HYSTERECTOMY, THE DEVICE BURNED THE PATIENT'S VULVA IN 3 PLACES. SILVADINE WAS APPLIED TO BURN AREAS.
1205780;1;"CERNER HAS DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION OCTOBER 15, 2008 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES. THE SOFTWARE NOTIFICATION INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND REMINDER TO ALERT THE CLIENT BASE OF THE DOCUMENTED INTENDED SOLUTION FUNCTIONALITY. ADDITIONALLY, CERNER HAS PROVIDED FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF INTENDED USE IN USER DOCUMENTATION. CERNER CORPORATION CONSIDERS THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AND NO FURTHER NARRATIVE IS REQUIRED FOR F/U. THE ISSUE INVOLVES THE CROSSMATCH REINSTATE FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN CERNER MILLENNIUM PATHNET BLOOD BANK TRANSFUSION AND AFFECTS SITES THAT UTILIZE THE REINSTATE CROSSMATCH PREFERENCE. THE CROSSMATCH REINSTATE FUNCTIONALITY IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW THE USER TO REINSTATE AN EXISTING CROSSMATCH AND EXTEND THE CROSSMATCH EXPIRATION BEYOND THE DEFAULT SPECIMEN EXPIRATION. WHEN A CROSSMATCH IS REINSTATED, THE CROSSMATCH EXPIRATION WILL BE UPDATED BASED ON THE REINSTATE CROSSMATCH PREFERENCE ""ENTER THE NUMBER OF HOURS/DAYS A REINSTATED CROSSMATCH SHOULD REMAIN ACTIVE."" THE VALUE ENTERED IN THE PREFERENCE WILL BE ADDED TO THE CURRENT DATE/TIME TO DETERMINE THE NEW CROSSMATCH EXPIRATION. THIS ALLOWS CLIENTS TO EXTEND THE CROSSMATCH EXPIRATION FOR PREOPERATIVE PTS WHO HAVE A NEGATIVE ANTIBODY SCREEN AND HAVE NOT BEEN PREGNANT OR TRANSFUSED WITHIN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS. FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE CROSSMATCH REINSTATE FUNCTIONALITY COULD RESULT IN THE INAPPROPRIATE EXTENSION OF THE CROSSMATCH EXPIRATION FOR PTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECENTLY TRANSFUSED OR PREGNANT. THESE PTS COULD HAVE DEVELOPED A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ANTIBODY AND COULD POTENTIALLY RECEIVE A RED BLOOD CELL PRODUCT THAT IS INCOMPATIBLE. THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS DESIGNED AND DOCUMENTED IN THE PATHNET BLOOD BANK TRANSFUSION DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS GUIDE. CERNER RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF AN ADVERSE PT EVENT REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. A UNIT OF RED CELLS WAS CROSSMATCHED ON A SPECIMEN FROM (B) (6) 2008 AND THEN RELEASED (UNTAGGED) ON (B) (6) 2008. WHEN BLOOD WAS NEEDED LATER ON (B) (6) 2008, THE CROSSMATCHED UNIT WAS RETAGGED (REINSTATED). THE UNIT WAS NOT ISSUED AND DID NOT APPEAR ON THE (B) (6) 2008 CERNER BATCH CROSSMATCH RELEASE REPORT WHICH IS USED BY THE BLOOD BANK TO RELEASE EXPIRED CROSSMATCHES. THE UNIT DID APPEAR ON THE REPORT ON (B) (6) 2008 BASED ON THE RETAGGING DATE AND NOT ON THE SPECIMEN EXPIRATION DATE AFTER THE UNIT WAS ISSUED TO THE PT ON (B) (6) 2008. THE CLIENT FILED A BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT DEVIATION (BPD) REPORT REGARDING THE CROSSMATCH ISSUE. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED COMMUNICATION OF PT INJURY OR DEATH IN RELATION TO THIS ISSUE."

SPACELABS TESTED A REMOTE DISPLAY CONTROLLER AND FOUND THE DEVICE OPERATED AS DESIGNED. THE REPORTED DELAY IS A RESULT OF INTERNAL PROCESSING THROUGH COMPONENTS, CABLES AND SIGNAL PROCESSING CIRCUITS, AND COMMUNICATION OF THE INFO FROM THE PRIMARY DISPLAY TO THE REMOTE DISPLAY THROUGH A NETWORK. SUCH A DELAY IS UNAVOIDABLE WHEN USING ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS AND REFLECTS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA TRANSMISSION ON A NETWORK.

1210117;0;"DAMAGE TO THE DISTAL SECTION OF THE CATHETER SHAFT WAS REPORTED. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE PT. NO PT CONSEQUENCES WERE REPORTED. ONE USED CATHETER WAS RECEIVED ON 10/7/2008. THE UNIT WAS VISUALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY EXAMINED. RESULTS OF THE TESTING AREA AS FOLLOWS: VISUAL INSPECTION FOUND CATHETER SHAFT DAMAGE AT THE DISTAL FUSE AREA 7.0 CM FROM THE DISTAL TIP. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE SHAFT WAS TWISTED NEAR THE DAMAGED LOCATION WHICH SUGGESTS THE CATHETER WAS SUBJECTED TO OVER-TORQUE. THE CATHETER WAS, HOWEVER, HELD TOGETHER BY THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS AS DESIGNED. CATHETERS FROM SIMILAR TUBING SHAFTS WERE PULLED FROM FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY AND WORST CASE CONDITIONS WERE SIMULATED. THE CATHETERS WERE PRECONDITIONED FOR 4 HOURS IN A HEATED 37 DEGREE CELSIUS WATER BATH (BODY TEMPERATURE), SUBJECTED TO REPETITIVE CYCLES OF FLEXION/DEFLECTION (40 CYCLES STEERING) FOLLOWED BY 720 DEGREE TWISTING FORCE (TORQUE) BASED ON THE SAME ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED DURING PRODUCT DESIGN. WITH EACH ROTATION THE FUSE AREA WAS EXAMINED UNDER A MICROSCOPE. EVIDENCE OF STRESS BUILDUP WAS OBSERVED DURING THE SIMULATION TESTING, HOWEVER, ALL THREE CATHETERS RETAINED MECHANICAL INTEGRITY AT GREATER THAN 2X THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. THE FAILURE MODE WAS NOT DUPLICATED EVEN AFTER 10 FULL ROTATIONS IN THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH IS BEYOND NORMAL USE. THE FUSING PROCESS IS CLOSELY MONITORED. PROCESS MONITORING DATA WAS REVIEWED FOR THE PERIOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THIS LOT AND EXCEEDS MINIMUM TENSILE STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS OF 3.37 POUNDS PER ISO. IN ALL CASES, THE CATHETER SHAFT STRETCHED BEFORE A FUSE JOINT FAILURE OCCURRED, INDICATING A STRONG FUSE JOINT. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR LOT K04540 WAS ALSO REVIEWED TO ENSURE ALL MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED AND REPORTED AS COMPLETE AND ACCEPTABLE. NO EVIDENCE OF A MANUFACTURING ERROR COULD BE FOUND. YEARS 2007 AND 2008 COMPLAINTS WERE REVIEWED. THIS IS A RARE OCCURRENCE. THE TEST DATA SUGGESTS THAT THE CATHETER WAS OVER-TORQUED BEYOND NORMAL USE. SINCE LOAD OR TENSION MUST BE PLACED ONTO THE CATHETER, THE DISTAL SECTION MAY HAVE BEEN ENTRAPPED IN A POCKET OF TISSUE. THE FUSING PROCESS AND TUBING TENSILE STRENGTH HAVE BEEN VALIDATED TO ENSURE MECHANICAL INTEGRITY UNDER NORMAL USE CONDITIONS. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE STATE ""EXCESSIVE BENDING OR KINKING OF THE CATHETER MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CATHETER."""
1210268;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEVICE WAS USED DURING A VIDEO LAPAROSCOPIC BARIATRIC PROCEDURE. DURING USE OF THE DEVICE, LEAKAGE WAS OBSERVED. ANOTHER DEVICE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE CASE.

1210986;0;"THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS REPORTED BY THE FIELD SALES ASSOCIATE IN 2008. ""DR IMPLANTED A DEVICE FOR AN AXILLO-POPL.L-BYPASS ON TWELVE DAYS EARLIER. PATIENT IS DOING WELL AND SHOULD BE DISCHARGED SEVERAL DAYS LATER. ON FOUR DAYS PRIOR TO ORIGINAL DATE, NEARLY 4 AM IN THE MORNING THE PT GOT BIG PAIN AND SHOWED A BIG HAEMATOMA IN THE AREA OF THE AXILLAR ANASTOMOSIS. THE PT WAS MOVED TO THE INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT AND FROM THERE DIRECTLY TO THE OR. WHEN HAVING OPENED THE HAEMATOMA WITH AN INCISION BLOOD SPLASHED OUT OF THE INCISION. THE PROSTHESIS HAD TEARED OFF (THE AXILLARY ANASTOMOSIS WAS O.K.) AND THE REST OF THE BYPASS WAS VERY HARD TO FIND. AFTER A BETTER SITUS, THEY GO THE REST OF THE PROSTHESIS, CLAMPED THE PROSTHESIS AND DID AN INTERPOSITION WITH AN 8MM GRAFT SO THAT COULD FLOW AGAIN. WHILE THE TIME OF ALL THESE PROCEDURES, THE PT GOT BLOOD INFUSIONS AND HAS BEEN REANIMATED. IN A BAD GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH, THE PT GOT OUT OF THE OR AND HAS BEEN REMOVED TO THE INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT, WHERE THE PT DIED AFTER SOME HRS. DR PLACED THE REST OF THE TEARED-OFF PROSTHESIS IN RINGER-SOLUTION. BECAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE PT, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD TO BE INVOLVED AND HE HAD TO HAND OUT THE REST OF THE EXPLANT TO THEM FOR EXAMINATION. ON TWO DAYS AFTER THE ORIGINAL DATE, THERE WILL BE A MEDICOLEGAL AUTOPSY OF THE PATIENT'S BODY."" FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS PENDING. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING PAPERWORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THE REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS FOR THE DEVICE VERIFIED THAT THE LOT MET ALL PRE-RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS."
1211205;0;EVALUATION: WE WERE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE REPORT AS IT WAS DESCRIBED BECAUSE THE AFFECTED PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED TO COOK ENDOSCOPY FOR EVALUATION. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THIS LOT NUMBER, WE CAN REPORT THAT NO DISCREPANCIES OR ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. WE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THIS LOT BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE PREVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED. A REVIEW OF THE TWELVE MONTH COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS PERCENTAGE, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS REMOTE. CONCLUSION: WE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED OBSERVATION WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED. BARREL DETACHMENT CAN OCCUR IF LUBRICANT IS ALLOWED INSIDE THE BARREL. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE DIRECT THE USER TO LUBRICATE THE ENDOSCOPE AND EXTERIOR PORTION OF THE BARREL. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ALSO CAUTION THE USER NOT TO PLACE LUBRICANT INSIDE THE BARREL. A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THIS EVENT INCLUDES ALLOWING BODY FLUIDS TO ENTER THE AREA BETWEEN THE BARREL AND ENDOSCOPE. PRIOR TO ASSEMBLING THE MULTI-BAND LIGATOR, ROUTINE ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION IS RECOMMENDED TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS REQUIRING TREATMENT OF ESOPHAGEAL VARICES. IF THE ENDOSCOPE IS WIPED FREE AFTER THE INITIAL CHECK FOR LOCATION OF THE VARICES, BODY FLUIDS IN THIS AREA CAN BE AVOIDED. IT IS POSSIBLE BODY FLUIDS AND/OR LUBRICATION REMAINED ON THE ENDOSCOPE DURING THE LOADING PROCESS, DECREASING FRICTION BETWEEN THE BARREL AND ENDOSCOPE CONTRIBUTING TO THE REPORTED EVENT. IF THE BARREL IS NOT ADVANCED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ONTO THE ENDOSCOPE, BARREL DETACHMENT CAN OCCUR. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ADVISE THE USER TO ENSURE THE BARREL IS ADVANCED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ONTO THE ENDOSCOPE. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL MULTI-BAND LIGATORS ARE SUBJECTED TO A VISUAL INSPECTION TO ENSURE DEVICE INTEGRITY. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD CONFIRMED THAT THIS LOT MET MFG REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. CORRECTIVE ACTION: NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WARRANTED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THIS REPORT WAS UNABLE TO BE VERIFIED. THE COMPLAINT RISK PRIORITY NUMBER (CRPN) FOR THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTCOME. BASED ON THIS CALCULATION, NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS REMOTE. CUSTOMER QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS. DURING AN ESOPHAGEAL BANDING PROCEDURE, THE PHYSICIAN USED A COOK ENDOSCOPY SIX SHOOTER SAEED MULTI-BRAND LIGATOR. ALL SIX-BANDS DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY. AFTER THE LAST BAND DEPLOYED, THE LIGATION BARREL DETACHED FROM THE ENDOSCOPE AND WAS LOCATED IN THE PT'S STOMACH. THE BARREL WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE STOMACH USING A DILATION BALLOON. NO ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PROCEDURES WERE REQUIRED DUE TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE PT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS DUE TO THIS OBSERVATION.

1214830;1;"DURING AN INVESTIGATION OF AN INCIDENT REPORTED BY ONE OF INTELERAD'S FIELD PERSONNEL IN (B)(4), INTELERAD MEDICAL IDENTIFIED A SOFTWARE DEFECT IN THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT CERTAIN IMAGES FROM BEING DISPLAYED WITH NO WARNING OR ALARM TO NOTIFY THE USER OF A FAILURE. WHEN RETRIEVING IMAGES USING THE DICOM SERVICE, AND WHEN THESE IMAGES ARE PROCESSED IN A BATCH, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTELEVIEWER DATABASE ON THE WORKSTATION MAY NOT BE UPDATED AND SOME IMAGES MAY NOT BE RETRIEVED. DEPENDING ON HOW THE IMAGES ARE LOADED, THIS MAY RESULT IN EITHER THE IMAGES NOT BEING SHOWN AT ALL (I.E. INTELEVIEWER REPORTING THAT THERE ARE FEWER IMAGES IN A SERIES THAN WERE SENT BY THE SERVER), OR A DELAY IN SHOWING THE IMAGES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE LOADED AGAIN.

1241963;1;"THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, IT WOULD ""FREEZE UP"". THE SYSTEM WAS POWERED DOWN AND RE-STARTED AND WITHIN A SHORT TIME, IT FROZE UP AGAIN. IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE PC LIGHTS WERE NOT LIT AND THE USER COULD NOT GET THE PC TO POWER UP OR DOWN. THE CASE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED USING THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM. THE CASE WAS COMPLETED USING FLUOROSCOPY AND SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT."
1242510;0;CUSTOMER REPORTED AN UNDER INFUSION OF NORMAL SALINE (NSS). NSS WAS INFUSING WITH 1000ML TO RUN OVER 1 HOUR. AFTER 1 HOUR THERE WAS A RESIDUAL OF 100ML AND AN ACTUAL RUN TIME WAS 1 HOUR 10 MINUTES. NO PATIENT HARM. PRODUCT RETURN IS NOT EXPECTED.
1244176;0;"RESULTS AND CONCLUSION SUMMATION - STROKE, AS NOTED IN THE XIENCE V INSTRUCTION FOR USE IS A KNOWN ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENTING AND IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY DEVICE MALFUNCTION AT THE TIME OF THE STENT IMPLANT AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DIRECT STENTING WAS PERFORMED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE XIENCE V IFU STATES: ""PRE-DILATE THE LESION WITH A PTCA."" IN THIS CASE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE HOSPITALIZATION IS A SECONDARY EFFECT OF THE STROKE. HOWEVER, A CONCLUSIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED PT EFFECTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEVICES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE DETERMINED. REPORTING STATUS: SERIOUS INJURY/PERMANENT DAMAGE. REPORTING RATIONALE: STROKE. DEVICE ISSUE: NO DEVICE MALFUNCTION HAS BEEN REPORTED. IT WAS REPORTED VIA A TRIAL THAT THE INITIAL PROCEDURE TOOK PLACE IN 2008, TO TREAT A DE NOVO, MILDLY TORTUOUS, AND A 75% STENOSED MILD LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) LESION. DIRECT STENTING WAS PERFORMED USING A 2.75 X 28 MM PROMUS DES. THE RESULT WAS 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS; HOWEVER, PRIOR TO DISCHARGE, THE PT EXPERIENCED A CEREBRAL VASCULAR ADVERSE EVENT (STROKE). THE PT WAS DISCHARGED AT ABOUT FOUR DAYS LATER. YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS MDR REPORT FROM ABBOTT VASCULAR BECAUSE BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION DISTRIBUTES PROMUS AS ITS OWN BRAND LABELING OF ABBOTT VASCULAR'S DRUG ELUTING STENT IN THE US."

1244971;0;AN INVESTIGATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY. UPON COMPLETION, THE RESULTS WILL BE FORWARDED. IT WAS REPORTED TO COVIDIEN IN 2008 THAT A CUSTOMER HAD AN ISSUE WITH A SHARPS CONTAINER. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHARPS CONTAINER WAS CRACKED, AND A NURSE WAS STUCK WITH A USED NEEDLE WHEN SHE WENT TO PICK UP THE SHARPS CONTAINER.
1246335;0;THE REPORTED BLOOD LOSS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATOR NOT PERFORMING RINSEBACK IN A TIMELY MANNER AS DIRECTED IN THE USER'S GUIDE. THE USER'S GUIDE PROVIDES ADEQUATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING AIR ALARMS. THE DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. THE CYCLER ALARMED APPROPRIATELY TO THE PRESENCE OF AIR. AIR ALARMS AT THE START OF TREATMENT ARE TYPICALLY DUE TO AIR ENTERING THE SYSTEM WHEN MAKING PATIENT CONNECTIONS OR INADEQUATE AIR REMOVAL DURING PRIME. A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN NXSTAGE SYSTEM ONE AND THE REPORTED BLOOD LOSS CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED. FACILITY STAFF HAS BEEN NOTIFIED. NXSTAGE MEDICAL CONSIDERS THIS REPORT CLOSED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS AN ADVERSE EVENT SOLELY TO COMPLY WITH THE FDA'S BLOOD LOSS POLICY. A VENOUS AIR ALARM OCCURRED AT THE START OF A ROUTINE HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT, WHICH COULD NOT BE RESOLVED BY THE OPERATOR. RINSEBACK WAS NOT PERFORMED DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT TROUBLESHOOTING THE ALARM, RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS OF 190CC. NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED.
1246344;0;ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER: THE DEVICE WAS FIRED BUT IT DID NOT PLACE STAPLES WHEN THE TISSUE WAS CUT. IT WAS NOTED WHEN THE OTHER INSTRUMENT THE EEA WAS INSERTED INTO THE RECTUM. MANUAL SUTURING WAS USED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. PATIENT HAD HAD A COLITIS SURGERY BEFORE THIS SURGERY AND HAS ANAL FISTULA, THEREFORE, THE TISSUE WAS ADHERED, HARD AND THICK. NO BLEEDING WAS REPORTED AND NOTHING FELL INTO THE PATIENT. MDR INITIAL REPORT SUBMITTED: 11/26/2008.
1246567;1;RADIOLOGISTS ARE COMPLAINING THAT WHEN SCROLLING THROUGH THE IMAGES OF A SERIES, THE SCROLLING APPEARS CHOPPY, HESITATES, JUMPS AHEAD AND IS NOT SMOOTH. THIS PROBLEM IS SEEN MORE PREDOMINATELY WITH MRI STUDIES THAN CT'S. HOWEVER, THE LARGER THE NUMBER OF IMAGES PER SERIES, THE MORE LIKELY A RADIOLOGIST WILL SEE THIS ISSUE. WHEN A STUDY IS SELECTED, IT POPULATES THE VIEWPORTS. THE RADIOLOGIST WILL SELECT A SERIES TO VIEW AND USING THE MOUSE WHEEL OR BY DEPRESSING THE WHEEL AND DRAGGING, THE IMAGES WILL, FOR INSTANCE, WILL INITIALLY SCROLL WITH HESITATION FROM IMAGE #1 TO IMAGE #5 AND THEN JUMP TO IMAGE #11 AND SO ON. THE APPEARANCE OF THE SERIES WHILE SCROLLING QUICKLY IS NOT A SMOOTH TRANSITION. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT ONCE THE USER HAS INITIALLY SCROLLED THROUGH THE SERIES, THE SCROLLING ISSUE IS NOT AS PRONOUNCED.
1246859;0;INFO ANTICIPATED, BUT UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A TOTAL LAPAROSCOPIC HYSTERECTOMY PROCEDURE, THE WHITE TISSUE PAD SLIPPED OFF THE TIPS. THE TISSUE PAD WAS RETRIEVED AND THE CASE WAS COMPLETED - NOTHING WAS USED IN REPLACEMENT OF THE ACE SHEARS AS THE SURGEON WAS CLOSE TO COMPLETING THE CASE. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE PT.
1247203;1;THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE SYSTEM, THERE ARE CONSISTENT INACCURACY ISSUES OF 1-3CM. THE USER REPORTED THAT THEY NAVIGATED TO WHERE THE SYSTEM WOULD TELL THEM TO AND WHEN THEY CHECKED WITH FLUOROSCOPY, IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THEY WERE NOT WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE CASE AND THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.
1247575;0;DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT BLOOD LEAKED OUT OF THE VAMP FLEX SYRINGE DURING THE BLOOD SAMPLING THREE DAYS AFTER THE ARTERY LINE WAS INDWELLED. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED.
1247580;0;THE MODULAR NECK OF THE PROSTHESIS FRACTURED. WHEN THE FRACTURE OCCURRED THE PATIENT WAS WALKING AND HE REPORTED THAT HE FELL. FROM THE ED NOTE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT INJURY HAPPENED IN THE FALL.

RESULTS: OF INSTRUMENT PART NO. 600-147 WITH LOT #110899, A TOTAL QUANTITY OF 40 INSTRUMENTS WERE MFG IN MARCH 1999 AND SHIPPED TO JARIT AGAINST THE FOLLOWING INVOICES: # 997170 OF 1999; # 997349 OF 1999; # 997416 OF 1999; #997584 OF 1999 AND # 997778 OF 1999. WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, A TOTAL OF 387 INSTRUMENTS OF PART NO. 600-147 HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO JARIT. A TREND ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY US BASED ON A COMPLAINT EVAL DID NOT REVEAL ANY STRIKING FEATURES INDICATING AN ACCUMULATIVE OCCURRENCE OF THIS TYPE OF NONCONFORMANCE. WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THERE HAVE NEITHER BEEN ANY COMPLAINTS NOR ANY MDR REPORTING OF THE DAMAGE DESCRIBED. UPON TRACING BACK THE LOT NUMBER IN QUESTION, WE FOUND THAT BOTH THE CORRECT MATERIAL AND COMPONENTS HAD BEEN USED AND THAT THE INSTRUMENT IS IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE PRODUCT SPECS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE INSTRUMENT REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: THE JAW PART BROKE OFF; A HARDNESS TEST PERFORMED ON THIS JAW RESULTED IN A VALUE OF HRC 47 (WITH HRC 44-48 BEING SPECIFIED). A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE JAW PART REVEALED CORROSION BOTH ON THE DRAW ROD AND IN THE HINGE AREA. THE FRACTURED SURFACE, TOO, SHOWS SIGNS OF CORROSION. CONCLUSION: THE INSTRUMENT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPECS. WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THIS DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY. BASED ON THE CORROSION SEEN ON THE FRACTURED SURFACE, WE SUSPECT THE JAW TO HAVE BEEN PRE-DAMAGED BY A FINE HAIRLINE CRACK. HAIRLINE CRACKS MAY RESULT FROM AN OVERSTRESSING OR A MISUSE OF AN INSTRUMENT DURING USE. SUCH CRACKS ARE PRONE TO BUILDING CORROSION, AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE CRACK INCREASES OVER TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THIS LEADS TO A GRADUAL DECREASE IN STABILITY WHICH ULTIMATELY MAKES THE JAW BREAK AT THE SMALLEST STRESS ACTING UPON IT. CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTION: BASED ON OUR EXAMINATION, WE HAVE NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER THAT EITHER THE DESIGN, MATERIAL OR MFG PROCESS, OR ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE HAVE GIVEN CAUSE FOR ANY CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTIVE ACTION TO BE INITIATED BY US. NO ACTION WILL THEREFORE BE TAKEN BY US."

THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT VERIFY OR IDENTIFY ANY EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT ERROR WITH REGARD TO THE REPORTED EVENT. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION, THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION IS NOT INDICATED. DEPUY CONSIDERS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSED. SHOULD THE PRODUCT OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT CHANGES THIS CONCLUSION BE RECEIVED, THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE REOPENED.
1263890;0;CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. WHILE RECURRENCE IS A KNOWN ADVERSE EVENT THAT IS LISTED IN THE IFU, NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. WE WILL SUBMIT A FOLLOW UP REPORT WHEN/IF PRODUCT IS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. REFER TO MDR 1213643-2008-00547 FOR INFORMATION REGARDING TO THE OTHER MESH THAT MAY BE RELATED TO THE EVENT. PATIENT REPORTED: IN LATE 2006 - PATIENT HAD AN INITIAL VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIR. SHE ISN'T SURE WHICH PATCH WAS USED (CATALOG NUMBER 0010202, LOT 43FQD171 AND/OR 0010205, LOT 43LQD214), BUT BOTH WERE BILLED TO HER. BY SEVENTEEN DAYS LATER, THE SURGICAL SITE WAS INFECTED AND HAD A STRONG ODOR. SHE IS ALSO DIABETIC, BUT IS UPSET THAT HER SURGEON MENTIONED THAT AS A POSSIBLE REASON WHY SHE DEVELOPED AN INFECTION AND HAS PROBLEMS HEALING. CURRENTLY, SHE FEELS AS THOUGH THE HERNIA HAS RECURRED, AND THAT SHE HAS BRUISING IN THE AREA OF THE REPAIR.

1264711;0;AS PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF TRUFIT PLUG COMPLAINTS (2004 TO 2007) WHICH WAS PRIOR TO SMITH-NEPHEW INTEGRATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT THIS COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE REPORTABLE. TWO IMPLANTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PT IN 2005. THE PT FELL AND LANDED ON THE KNEE WHERE THE IMPLANTS WERE LOCATED. PAIN AND INTERMITTENT CLICKING WERE A RESULT. THE SURGEON DID A SECOND SURGERY SUSPECTING A MENISCAL TEAR AND A POSSIBLE LOOSENING OF THE IMPLANTS. DURING THE SECOND SURGERY, THE IMPLANTS WERE REPORTED TO BE CONCAVE AND SOFT IN NATURE. BOTH AREAS WERE CORED OUT AND TWO NEW IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN PLACE.
1265384;1;THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE SYSTEM THERE WAS A REGISTRATION ISSUE. THE USER REPORTED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET AN ACCEPTABLE REGISTRATION VALUE. THE SITE SUSPECTED THAT A COMPONENT OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, THE PT SENSOR TRIPLET, WAS FAULTY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SITE COULD NOT LOCATE THE BACK-UP PT SENSOR TRIPLET SO THE CASE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. THE PT WAS UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.
1266244;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN 2008, DUE TO INTERMITTENT BACLOFEN WITHDRAWAL. THE PT WAS ADMINISTERED A BOLUS AND THE UNSPECIFIED SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED. THE SYMPTOMS THEN RETURNED AFTER 24 HOURS. THE PT WAS READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL TWO DAYS LATER. THE PT UNDERWENT PUMP REPLACEMENT ON THE SAME DAY, AS IT WAS ""NOT INFUSING"".

1267024;0;THE HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT, DURING TESTING, THE COMMAND MODULE DID NOT PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE ECG OUTPUT SIGNAL TO AN EXTERNAL DEVICE. UPON FIRST ANALYSIS, THIS APPEARED TO BE A COMPONENT BATCH PROBLEM. HOWEVER, LOOKING AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FAILURES LEADS US TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS VERY LIMITED. A TOTAL COMMAND MODULES WERE TESTED AND SOME FAILURES WERE FOUND. THESE THE DEVICE FAILURES WERE IN A NARROW RANGE- CONSECUTIVE SERIAL NUMBERS. OF THE TOTAL MODULES PRODUCED FROM APRIL 2005 (ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE DATE CODE OF THOSE 9), THROUGH APRIL 2008, ONLY 5 OTHER SIMILAR FAILURES WERE RECORDED. THEREFORE WE ARE CONCLUDING THAT THE FAILURES WERE LIMITED TO A VERY SMALL MANUFACTURING BATCH, AND THE PROBABILITY OF FUTURE FAILURES IS WITHIN THE NORMAL EXPECTED RATE FOR THESE COMPONENTS. WE WILL REVIEW THE USAGE OF THIS PART AT THE NEXT AUDIT OF OUR FACTORY REPAIR DEPARTMENT. WE CONSIDER THIS CASE TO BE CLOSED.
1267809;0;MFR RECEIVED AN INSURANCE CLAIM OF PROPERTY DAMAGE AND AN ALLEGED INJURY WHICH BOTH ARE UNCONFIRMED.

1267946;1;THE ISSUE INVOLVES MEDICAL DEVICE INTEGRATION. THE +PR SOFTWARE FLAG ALLOWS FOR A NEW CAPABILITY TO APPEND A VALUE TO THE RESULT BASED ON A GIVEN ERROR CODE SENT BY THE DEVICE. THIS IS MANAGED BY THE INTERFACE CREATING A FLAT FILE ON THE NETWORK, WHICH DEFINES APPENDING THE < SIGN FOR AN ERROR FLAG OF 4 AND A > SIGN FOR AN ERROR FLAG OF 5. THIS IS NOT CORRECT. THE FLAT FILE SHOULD HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO APPEND THE > SIGN FOR AN ERROR FLAG 4 AND A < SIGN FOR AN ERROR FLAG OF 5, AND THE INTERFACE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CYCLED IN CERNER ENTERPRISE MANAGER. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED COMMUNICATION ON ANY ADVERSE PATIENT EVENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. CERNER DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION ON (B) (6), 2008 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES. THE SOFTWARE NOTIFICATION INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND A SOFTWARE MODIFICATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR ALL SITES THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED.

UPON THE INITIAL CONTACT TO BAXA, THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENT, BUT DID STATE THAT IT WAS ""USER ERROR DURING ORDER ENTRY."" THE CUSTOMER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR ABACUS DATABASE AND COMPOUNDER DATABASE FOR EVALUATION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ABACUS DATABASE REVEALED THAT THE ORDER WAS ENTERED ON (B)(6) 2008. THE ORDER CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS: 40 MEQ/DL NA CHLORIDE, 40 MEQ/DL NA ACETATE, 30 MEQ/DL K CHLORIDE. THE TOTAL VOLUME OF THE BAG WAS 1000 ML. THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUS DAY'S ORDER HAD A UNIT VALUE OF MEQ/L RATHER THAN THE SUBJECT'S ORDER UNIT VALUE OF MEQ/DL. THEREFORE, BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED FOR ANALYSIS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE OVER-DELIVERY WAS THE SELECTION OF MEQ/DL, RATHER THAN MEQ/L BY THE USER COMPLETING ORDER ENTRY. THE ABACUS DATABASE SHOWED THAT THE SOFTWARE DISPLAYED WARNING LIMITS FOR ACETATE, CHLORIDE AND POTASSIUM. RATIONALE WAS GIVEN TO ALL THREE WARNING LIMITS AS ""OK"" AND THE ORDER WAS COMPLETED. A SITE VISIT WAS CONDUCTED ON (B)(6) 2008, TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. DURING THE SITE VISIT, EXTENSIVE ABACUS ORDER ENTRY TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED.

1298183;0;AFTER TREATMENT WITH JUVEDERM ULTRA PLUS IN THE UPPER LIPS, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH SWELLING AND SEVERE INFLAMMATION AT THE INJECTION SITE FOLLOWED BY HARDENING OF THE PRODUCT AT THE INJECTION SITE. THE PATIENT WAS ADMINISTERED DECADRON 8MG INTRAMUSCULARLY AND PRESCRIBED MEDROL DOSE PAK. THE PHYSICIAN NOTED THAT PATIENT SYMPTOMS RESOLVED INDICATING THAT THERE WERE NO SIGN OF INFECTION. MEDWATCH SENT TO FDA ON 01/28/2009. DEVICE EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT NO ELEMENT COULD EXPLAIN THESE REACTIONS: ALL THE MANUFACTURING STEPS AND ALL THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL RESULTS (ENDOTOXINS, BIOBURDEN, STERILITY TEST, STERILISATION CYCLE) ARE REGISTERED AS CONFORMING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PATIENT HAD AN UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECT TO THE INJECTIONS, AS INDICATED IN THE DFU (EDEMA, INFLAMMATION, INDURATION AT THE INJECTION SITES CAN OCCUR).
1298507;0;PROCEDURE: IMPLANT. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER: IN 2008, THE PORT WAS IMPLANTED. IT WAS IMPLANTED ON THE PATIENT'S LEFT SITE IN AN ABNORMAL LOCATION, BECAUSE OF HIS HOBBY HUNTING. DUE TO THE DISTANCE OF THE PORT-CHAMBER AND AS A RESULT THE NECESSITY OF A LARGE ARCH OF THE CATHETER, THE LENGTH OF THE CATHETER WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A CORRECT PLACEMENT IN THE RIGHT HEART VENTRICLE. THE RESULTING TENSION ON THE CATHETER HAS CAUSED A PROGRESSIVE DISLOCATION OF THE CATHETER, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY AN X-RAY PICTURE AT ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER. THIS X-RAY WAS TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE POORLY OPERATING PORT SYSTEM. AFTER THE TOTAL MALFUNCTION OF THE PORT , IT WAS NO LONGER USED. IT IS ASSUMED THAT A FURTHER BEND DOWN TOOK PLACE, WHICH IS ALSO THE OPINION OF THE SENIOR PHYSICIAN, WHO EXPLANTED THE PORT. THE LOCATION OF THE BREAK IS EQUIVALENT TO THE IMPRESSION OF THE X-RAY PICTURE. THE PORT-SYSTEM WAS EXPLANTED IN 2009. DURING PULLING THE PORT-CATHETER, IT BROKE AWAY INSIDE OF THE VESSEL AND SLIPPED INTO THE RIGHT HEART VENTRICLE. THIS WAS CONFIRMED VIA X-RAY. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL FOR HEART SURGERY, WHERE THE PORT-CATHETER WAS REMOVED BY MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY THROUGH THE GROIN.

1312412;1;ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT AND WE WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE ISSUE BOTH BY REMOTELY ACCESSING THE PRODUCT AT THE REPORTING CUSTOMER SITE, AS WELL AS ADD'L EVALUATION OF THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. INVESTIGATION RESULTS SHOW THAT ISITE PACS IS BEHAVING CORRECTLY, AS DESIGNED, IN CONFORMANCE TO (B)(4) AND (B)(4) REQUIREMENTS, FOR MEASUREMENT CALCULATION OF MAGNIFIED IMAGES. THE (B)(4) TAG ISITE PACS USES FOR MEASUREMENTS OF MAGNIFIED IMAGES IS IMAGER PIXEL SPACING (B)(4). THIS IS CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE IFU OF OUR PRODUCT. THE (B)(4) STANDARD SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS TAG SHALL NEVER BE ADJUSTED TO ACCOUNT FOR A MAGNIFICATION FACTOR. A THIRD PARTY MODALITY, IS ADJUSTING THE IMAGER PIXEL SPACING TAG (B)(4) FOR MAGNIFICATION PRIOR TO SENDING TO ISITE PACS. EVEN THOUGH ISITE PACS IS BEHAVING CORRECTLY, AND THERE IS NO DEFECT IN THE MEASURING FUNCTION, THE RESULT MAGNIFICATION FACTOR IS ACCOUNTED FOR TWICE (THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE TAG IS, INCORRECTLY, ADJUSTED BY THE MODALITY, AND A SECOND TIME DURING THE MEASUREMENT CALCULATION WITHIN ISITE PACS) AND THE DISPLAYED MEASUREMENT IS INCORRECT. WE HAVE PROVIDED THE CUSTOMER A SUMMARY OF THE ISSUE AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO CONTACT THE MODALITY VENDOR. AS WELL, WE ARE WORKING TO IDENTIFY A CONTACT AT THE MODALITY VENDOR TO ENSURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE, IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION FOR THE CUSTOMER. NO REPORT OF PT HARM OR INJURY RELATED TO THIS EVENT. CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT MEASUREMENTS FOR AN OBJECT OF KNOWN DIAMETER WERE DIFFERENT TO MAGNIFIED VIEW VERSUS REGULAR VIEW.

1312944;0;"EVAL SUMMARY: THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DISTAL TIP OF THE BLADE BROKEN OFF, THE TISSUE PAD MELTED AND B-FORM STAPLES EMBEDDED IN THE TISSUE PAD, EVIDENCE THAT THE BLADE HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ANOTHER METAL. THE REMAINING BLADE PORTION WAS SCRATCHED. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF BLADE DAMAGE INCLUDING BREAKAGE, ARE EXTERNAL CONTACT DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE, BLADE CONTACT WITH OTHER DEVICES, STAPLES OR CLIPS DURING THE PROCEDURE, OR USING ANY MEANS OTHER THAN THE BLADE WRENCH TO ATTACH OR DETACH THE BLADE. ONCE MINOR BLADE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED, SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATIONS MAY INCREASE DAMAGE SEVERITY AND RESULT IN BLADE ""LOCKOUT"" LATER IN THE PROCEDURE, AND CONTINUED USAGE CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN BLADE. POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE TISSUE PAD DAMAGE IS APPLYING PRESSURE BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENT BLADE AND TISSUE PAD WITHOUT HAVING TISSUE BETWEEN THEM. AND ACTIVATING THE BLADE WITHOUT TISSUE BETWEEN THE BLADE AND TISSUE PAD TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE TISSUE PAD. BOTH CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE INSTRUMENT."

THE NATURE OF THE BROKEN SCREW WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED.
1316458;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD WAS HAVING PROBLEMS. IT WOULD NOT WORK UNLESS PLUGGED IN. NO MATTER HOW LONG IT WAS CHARGED, AS SOON AS IT WAS UNPLUGGED, IT WOULD TURN OFF. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO RETURN THE OLD HANDHELD BACK TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1316461;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE SCREEN WOULD FREEZE UPON INTERROGATION. A HARD RESET RESOLVED THE ISSUE. IT WAS TOLD TO THE SITE TO GIVE A CALL BACK IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER PROBLEMS.
1316492;1;CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT WHEN A PHYSICIAN IS DICTATING A PT IN THE DICTATION TAB AND IS REQUESTED TO REVIEW ANOTHER PT'S IMAGES UNDER THE BROWSE TAB, THE PHYSICIAN IS PROMPTED TO SAVE OR CANCEL THE DICTATION HE WAS DICTATING ON. IF THE PHYSICIAN CHOOSES CANCEL, WHEN HE SELECTS THE PT UNDER THE BROWSE TAB, THE INFO IS SENT TO TALK. WHEN THE PHYSICIAN RETURNS TO THE DICTATE TAB AND BEGINS DICTATION ON THE PT HE WAS PREVIOUSLY DICTATING ON, THE PT INFO FOR THE PT SELECTED IN THE BROWSE TAB IS STILL IN TALK. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE AS THIS IS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE UPDATED THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD AND THE UPDATE HAS RESULTED IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT MEETS THE REPORTABILITY CRITERIA AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD FOR GE HEALTHCARE. THIS WORKFLOW SEQUENCE IS TIED TO A DUAL MODE RA-1000 AND TALK STATION EXTENDS. DUAL MODE INSTALL IS RA1000 CLIENT AND TALK STATION CLIENT INSTALL OF RUNNING ON SEPARATE MACHINES COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH EXTENDS. IN THIS INSTALLATION, WHEN A PHYSICIAN IS DICTATING ON A PT IN THE DICTATION TAB OF RA1000 AND ATTEMPTS TO OPEN A COMPLETED REPORT UNDER WORK MODES PALETTE, THE PHYSICIAN IS PROMPTED TO OWN, CONTRIBUTE OR CANCEL THE DICTATION IN TALK STATION. IF A PHYSICIAN CHOOSES CANCEL IN TALK, THE TALK STATION WILL STILL HAVE THE PREVIOUS PT'S INFO IN ITS HEADER, BUT THE BODY IS BLANK. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PHYSICIAN TO DICTATE THE WRONG INFO ON THE PT. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WILL BE PERFORMED. THIS WILL BE RESOLVED WITH THE RELEASE OF 3.0.5.3. (B) (4).
1316494;1;THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED IF ADDITIONAL INFO BECOMES AVAILABLE. (B) (4). AT INTERVALS, PHYSICIANS USING RA1000 (B) (4) AND EXTENDS WITH POWERSCRIBE 4.7, ARE DICTATING THE WRONG EXAM. IT APPEARS THAT THIS OCCURS WHEN THE RADIOLOGIST WHO USUALLY WORKS IN DICTATE MODE, LEAVES DICTATE MODE INTO BROWSE MODE TO LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAM, INTERRUPTING THEIR NORMAL WORKFLOW. THEY THEN RETURN TO DICTATE, AND THE DICTATION DOES NOT TIE IN CORRECTLY.
1317076;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD FREEZE DURING INTERROGATION. PHYSICIAN STATED THAT TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED BUT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RESOLVED.

1320813;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LAP GASTRIC PROCEDURE, AFTER THREE TO FOUR MINUTES OF USE, A LOUD RATTLE NOISE WAS HEARD AND THE WHITE PAD FELL OFF INTO THE PT. THE PAD WAS RETRIEVED AND A NOTHER DEVICE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE TO THE PT. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS FOUND THAT THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE TISSUE PAD MISSING AND THE BLADE GOUGED. BLADE DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY CONTACTING AN ACTIVE BLADE WITH OTHER SURGICAL DEVICES, STAPLES OR CLIPS DURING THE PROCEDURE OR USING ANY MEANS OTHER THAN THE BLADE WRENCH TO ATTACH OR DETACH THE BLADE. AS THE TISSUE PAD WAS NOT RETURNED, FURTHER EVALUATION COULD NOT BE PERFORMED. EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED DURING THIS INSPECTION AND TESTING. HOWEVER, A CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN INITIATED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY WERE REPORTED TO US. IN ADDITION, COMPLAINT INFO IS TRENDED ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. THE BATCH HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED DURING THE MFG PROCESS.
1321138;1;THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED UPON NOTIFICATION FROM OUR X-RAY, TO SUBMIT THIS EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. PROBLEM: PT AND IMAGE DATA CAN BE EXCHANGED IN THIS PICTURE ARCHIVING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (PACS). A PT'S NAME AND IMAGE(S) CAN BE EXCHANGED WITH ANOTHER PT.
1321187;0;CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT, AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. WE, THEREFORE, CONSIDER THIS REPORT COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE. THE CUSTOMER'S WIFE STATED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS TREATED BY PARAMEDICS DUE TO HYPOGLYCEMIA. THE REPORTED BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS 28 MG/DL. AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT, THE INSULIN PUMP ALARMED NO DELIVERY. WHEN THE INFUSION SET WAS REMOVED FROM THE CUSTOMER'S BODY, THE CANNULA WAS BENT. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED.
1321322;1;IT IS UNK AT THIS TIME WHETHER THIS IS RELATED TO A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION. THE ISSUE IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE WITH IN-HOUSE TESTING OF THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION. ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. NO REPORT OF PT HARM OR INJURY RELATED TO THIS EVENT. WE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FROM A CUSTOMER REPORTING THAT IMAGES AVAILABLE PREVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE FOUND. INVESTIGATION INTO THE REPORTED OCCURRENCE IS ONGOING. A F/U REPORT WILL BE ISSUED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.

1321427;0;A MALE UNDERWENT AAA REPAIR IN EARLY 2009. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO USE A FLEX MAIN BODY GRAFT BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL GETTING THE DEVICE UP THE ILIACS. THE LEFT ILIAC ARTERY HAD SO MUCH CALCIFICATIONS THAT A 20 FRENCH DILATOR BARELY WENT UP. THE RIGHT SIDE HAD A STENT THAT THE MAIN BODY COULD NOT GET THROUGH. THE PT ENDED UP LOSING 2 LITERS OF BLOOD, SO THE PHYSICIAN STOPPED THE CASE. THE PT WAS GIVEN TWO UNITS OF BLOOD AND WILL NEED TO BE CONVERTED TO OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR AT A LATER DATE. EVENT EVALUATION: STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.

1323469;0;RETURNED PRODUCT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED UNIT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE UNIT REVEALED DAMAGE TO THE PROXIMAL EDGE OF THE STENT. SOME PROXIMAL STENT STRUTS WERE RAISED AT AN ANGLE OF 90 DEGREES. THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DELIVERY SYSTEM ENCOUNTERING SOME FORM OF RESTRICTION. SOLIDIFIED BLOOD WAS PRESENT WITHIN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE INFLATION LUMEN, THEREFORE INDICATING THE DEVICE HAD BEEN USED IN VIVO. ATTEMPTS TO INSERT THE RECOMMENDED SIZE GUIDE WIRE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO SOLIDIFIED BLOOD PRESENT WITHIN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE LUMEN. THE BALLOON AND TIP SECTIONS OF THE DEVICE WERE VISUALLY AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED, AND NO ISSUES WERE NOTED WITH THEIR PROFILES THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY WRAPPED AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANY POSITIVE PRESSURE. A REVIEW OF THE TOP ASSEMBLY SHOP FLOOR PAPERWORK FOUND THAT THE DEVICE MET ITS MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS COMPLAINT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO HANDLING DAMAGE. THIS COMPLAINT IS NOW REPORTABLE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS COMPLETED IN 2007. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE 2.50X28MM TAXUS LIBERTE DRUG ELUTING STENT (DES) WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THE 80% STENOSED, SEVERELY TORTUOUS AND CALCIFIED LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX). NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. HOWEVER, RETURNED PRODUCT ANALYSIS REVEALED DAMAGE TO THE PROXIMAL EDGE OF THE STENT.
1323602;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY DRUG ELUTING STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, STENT DAMAGE OCCURRED. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A 20MM BALLOON, UNKNOWN TYPE. WHEN THE DOCTOR OPENED THE STENT HE NOTICED "" UN NORMAL SHAPE IN THE STENT EDGE, SO HE DECIDED TO ENGAGE THE STENT MANUALLY ACROSS THE VESSEL."" THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO PLACE A TAXUS LIBERTE' 2.5X28MM DRUG ELUTING STENT TO THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY, BUT WAS UNABLE TO CROSS A PREVIOUSLY PLACED STENT. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO CROSS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. UPON REMOVAL OF THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE EDGE OF THE STENT WAS DEFORMED. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITH ANOTHER DEVICE. NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT STATUS POST PROCEDURE IS NOTED AS STABLE. FOLLOWING A DETAILED DEVICE ANALYSIS, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED UNIT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. THE COMPLAINT REPORT STATED THAT UPON OPENING THE DEVICE THE PHYSICIAN NOTICED THE EDGE OF THE STENT TO BE ABNORMAL AND SO DECIDED TO ENGAGE THE STENT MANUALLY ACROSS THE VESSEL. IT IS ADVISED IN SECTION 9.3.2 (GUIDEWIRE LUMEN FLUSH) TO ""CHECK FOR BENDS, KINKS AND OTHER DAMAGE. DO NOT USE IF ANY DEFECTS ARE NOTED."" INITIAL VISUAL EXAMINATION NOTED NO DAMAGE TO THE EDGES OF THE STENT AS PER REPORTED, HOWEVER, SEVERAL STENT STRUTS WERE PULLED AND MIS-ALIGNED IN THE CENTER OF THE STENT. THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DELIVERY SYSTEM ENCOUNTERING SOME FORM OF RESTRICTION. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE PROFILES OF THE DEVICE, INCLUDING THE CRIMPED STENT AND THE BALLOON FOUND NO ISSUES WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A RESTRICTION OCCURRING DURING THE PHYSICIANS' ATTEMPTS TO CROSS THE LESION. A REVIEW OF THE SHOP FLOOR PAPERWORK FOUND THAT THE DEVICE MET ITS MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE TO DISTRIBUTION. THE ROOT CAUSE IS DETERMINED TO BE UNKNOWN."

1326971;0;"NOTE: THIS REPORT PERTAINS TO THE FIRST OF THREE DEVICES THAT FAILED DURING THE PROCEDURE. REFER TO MFG. REPORT #S 3005099803-2008-5856, 3005099803-2008-5858. IN 2008, IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION, THAT A RESOLUTION CLIP DEVICE WAS USED DURING AN ESO HEMOSTASIS (PATIENT AGE, GENDER, WEIGHT UNKNOWN). ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINAINT, AFTER THE CLIP CATHETER EXITED THE WORKING CHANNEL OF SCOPE, THE NURSE TRIED TO OPEN THE CLIP AND REALIZED THAT THE CLIP DISLODGED FROM THE CATHETER EVEN BEFORE RELEASING IT. THIS FAILURE OCCURRED TWICE MORE. THE PHYSICIAN DECIDED THAT THE PATIENT WOULD EVENTUALLY PASS THE CLIP. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH AN UNKNOWN DEVICE. THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS AND THE PATIENT'S CONDITION WAS REPORTED AS ""STABLE."" THE LOT NUMBER IS UNKNOWN; CONSEQUENTLY, THE MANUFACTURE AND EXPIRATION DATES ARE UNKNOWN. THE COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE HAS BEEN DISPOSED; THEREFORE, A FAILURE ANALYSIS IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DEVICE AND THE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT."
1327068;0;"A VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE REVEALED NO APPARENT SIGNS OF DAMAGE OR IMPERFECTIONS. FURTHER EVALUATION FOUND THE CATHETER HAD A RUPTURED ANCHORING BALLOON, WHICH LEAKED WHEN TESTED. THE CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT IS CONFIRMED. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THE PROLIEVE THERMODILATATION KIT LOT # 0000606603 WAS PERFORMED, NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINANT, DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE PROLIEVE SYSTEM'S ANCHORING BALLOON APPEARED TO BE LEAKING. IN ADDITION, THE PROLIEVE CATHETER WOULD NOT STAY IN PLACE. THE PHYSICIAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE PROCEDURE WITH ANOTHER PROLIEVE THERMODILATATION KIT. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. THE PATIENT'S CONDITION WAS REPORTED AS ""FINE."""
1327220;0;THE PT WAS REVISED BECAUSE THE PATELLA LOOSENED, POLY WEAR OF THE INSERT NOTED. THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEPUY WILL NOTIFY THE FDA OF THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION ONCE IT HAD BEEN COMPLETED.
1327320;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY (PTCA) PROCEDURE, A GUIDE WIRE TIP DETACHMENT OCCURRED. THE 100% STENOSED LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. THE VESSEL WAS SEVERELY CALCIFIED AND MODERATELY TORTUOUS. THE CHOICE GUIDE WIRE DISTAL TIP DETACHED DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PHYSICIAN HAD MADE A ""SEVERE BEND"" IN THE WIRE. THE TIP WAS NOT ATTEMPTED TO BE RETRIEVED. THE PROCEDURE WAS NOT COMPLETED. NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. THE PATIENT STATUS IS REPORTED AS ""OK"". THE COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION WAS NOT ABLE TO BE DONE BECAUSE, THE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT REPORTED. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT, DUE TO ANATOMICAL / PROCEDURAL FACTORS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PROCEDURE WHICH LIMITED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE."
1327432;0;DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE, A TYPE B DISSECTION WHICH WAS NON-FLOW LIMITING OCCURRED AFTER PRE-DILATION WITH AVIATOR (CORDIS) 15 X 4.0 MM AND A 20 X 5.0 MM BALLOONS. THE PT WAS ASYMPTOMATIC. AN 8 X 40 MM PRECISE STENT WAS DEPLOYED AND THEN POST-DILATED WITH A 5 MM BALLOON YIELDING 20% RESIDUAL STENOSIS AND EXCELLENT RESULT WITH TIMI III FLOW AND NO NEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS. THE BALLOON PACKAGING WERE DISCARDED, SO THE CATALOG AND LOT NUMBERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR TESTING AND EVALUATION. ADDITIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE. A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM THE SAPPHIRE STUDY INDICATED THAT A TYPE B DISSECTION OCCURRED DURING LESION PRE-DILATION WITH TWO AVIATOR BALLOONS. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDES HYPERLIPIDAEMIA, CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, DIABETES MELLITUS, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. THE TARGET LESION LOCATION WAS THE OSTIUM LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY (L6). THERE WAS NO OCCLUSION OF THE CONTRALATERAL CAROTID. THE LESION LENGTH MEASURED 20.0 IN A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 5.0. THE TARGET LESION DIAMETER STENOSIS WAS 90.0 AND THE TOTAL LENGTH OF STENTED SEGMENT WAS 40.0. THERE WAS MODERATE TORTUOSITY DOCUMENTED. AN ANGIOGUARD DISTAL PROTECTION DEVICE WAS DELIVERED WITHOUT DIFFICULTIES AND GOOD WALL APPOSITION WAS REPORTED. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH TWO AVIATOR PTA BALLOONS, A 15 X 4.0 MM AND A 20 X 5.0 MM AT 4 ATMS. YIELDING IMPROVEMENT IN THE DEGREE OF STENOSIS. HOWEVER, A NON-FLOW LIMITING GRADE B DISSECTION WAS NOTED. THEN AN 8X40MM PRECISE STENT WAS IMPLANTED SUCCESSFULLY. THE RESIDUAL DIAMETER STENOSIS MEASURED 20%. THE ANGIOGUARD WAS RETRIEVED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND NO DEBRIS WAS FOUND IN THE BASKET. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY AND THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT. THE PRODUCTS WERE NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. DISSECTIONS ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IFU. AT THIS TIME, THE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE PT, VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THIS IS ONE OF TWO REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED EVENT THAT WERE SUBMITTED UNDER THE FOLLOWING MANUFACTURING NUMBERS 9610978-2009-00048.
1327457;0;AN INFUSION PUMP WAS PROGRAMMED TO INFUSE AN ANTIBIOTIC IN THE SECONDARY MODE.  THE SECONDARY RATE WAS PROGRAMMED FOR 100 ML/HR AND THE VTBI (VOLUME TO BE INFUSED) WAS 100 ML.  THE ANTIBIOTIC SHOULD HAVE INFUSED OVER ONE HOUR.  HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 5-7 MINUTES AFTER THE SECONDARY INFUSION WAS STARTED, THE PUMP ALARMED BAG EMPTY. THE NURSE VERIFIED THE 100 ML ANTIBIOTIC INFUSION WAS EMPTY.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE SECONDARY PUMP SETTINGS WERE CHECKED, THE VTBI WAS 84 ML.
1327573;0;"ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION RECEIVED, WITH GUIDANCE OF INTRACARDIAC ULTRASOUND, THE ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT WAS BALLOON SIZED BY THE STOP-FLOW METHOD AS WELL AS THE WAIST MEASUREMENT BY BOTH ECHO AND FLUOROSCOPY. THE DEFECT WAS MEASURED AT 14MM AND A 16MM AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER WAS DEPLOYED AND RELEASED. AFTER RELEASE, THE DEVICE EMBOLIZED THROUGH THE LEFT ATRIUM OUT INTO THE LEFT VENTRICLE, THROUGH THE AORTIC VALVE AND DOWN INTO THE DESCENDING AORTA. THE PATIENT HAD A VERY ANEURYSMAL SEGMENT OF THE INTRA-ATRIAL SEPTUM WHICH SEEMINGLY DID NOT HOLD THE DEVICE IN POSITION. THE DEVICE WAS PERCUTANEOUSLY RETRIEVED WITH A MICRO SNARE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE PATIENT DID NOT HAVE ANY SEQUELAE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT. IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE PATIENT WILL BE REFERRED FOR SURGICAL CLOSURE OF THE ASD OF IF ANOTHER PERCUTANEOUS ATTEMPT WILL BE PERFORMED. AGA MEDICAL COULD NOT EVALUATE THE AMPLATZER SEPTAL OCCLUDER INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT SINCE IT IS BEING RETAINED BY THE HOSPITAL AT THIS TIME; HOWEVER, THIS DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED ACCORDING TO AGA MEDICAL SPECIFICATIONS AS EVIDENCED BY THE REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD. SHOULD THE DEVICE BECOME AVAILABLE AT A LATER DATE, WE WILL REOPEN THIS FILE. REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND IMAGING BY AGA'S MEDICAL CONSULTANT RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT ASO PLACEMENT FOR AN ATRIAL LEVEL COMMUNICATION. THE FLUOROSCOPY CD THAT WAS RECEIVED DEMONSTRATED THE BALLOON SIZING AND DEVICE PLACEMENT IN ADDITION TO CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY. THE DEPLOYED DEVICE DISCS WERE NOTED TO BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THERE WAS NO SEPARATION DURING THE GENTLE PULL-PUSH MANEUVER. IT SEEMED THAT BOTH DISCS WERE EITHER ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT SIDE OF THE SEPTUM. THE ECHOCARDIOGRAM CD THAT WAS RECEIVED WAS VERY HELPFUL IN DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF THE DEVICE EMBOLIZATION. ICE SHOWED AN ATRIAL COMMUNICATION WITH A THICK LIMBUS, ACCEPTABLE AORTIC RIM AND A THIN, SIGNIFICANTLY ANEURYSMAL SEPTUM PRIMUM. THE DEGREE OF MOBILITY WAS EXTREME BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUNDANCY OF THE SEPTUM. THE ATRIAL COMMUNICATION ANATOMICALLY LOOKED LIKE A PFO. THE DEGREE OF SEPARATION OF THE SEPTUM PRIMUM AND SECUNDUM WAS ABOUT 10 MM AT THE MINIMUM AND VARIED WITH EACH CARDIAC CYCLE. BALLOON SIZING WAS PERFORMED USING STOP-FLOW DIAMETER AND MEASURED AT 14MM AND A 16MM DEVICE WAS CHOSEN. AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF BOTH DISCS, THE RIGHT DISC DID NOT COVER THE SEPTUM SECUNDUM (THICK LIMBUS). THE RIGHT DISC SLOWLY GOT PUSHED TOWARD THE LEFT SIDE AND IN SOME FRAMES THE EDGE PUSHED INTO THE LIMBUS. AFTER RELEASE, THE DEVICE EMBOLIZED AND WAS SEEN IN THE DESCENDING AORTA. IT WAS RETRIEVED SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE HELP OF A SNARE. THE PATIENT HAD NO ILL EFFECTS RELATED TO THE DEVICE EMBOLIZATION. ACCORDING TO AGA'S MEDICAL CONSULTANT, THIS DEFECT WAS A STRETCHED PFO THAT LOOKED LIKE AN ASD. IT HAD A HIGHLY ANEURYSMAL SEPTUM PRIMUM AND A VERY THICK SEPTUM SECUNDUM. BASED ON THE IMAGES PROVIDED, IMPROPER BALLOON SIZING-STOP FLOW DIAMETER WAS NOT ACHIEVED COMPLETELY AND THE DEVICE PROVED TO BE UNSTABLE PRIOR TO RELEASE. THE RIGHT DISC DID NOT COVER THE LIMBUS AND SQUEEZED ONTO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LIMBUS. IN DEFECTS THAT ARE SHAPED LIKE PFO'S, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE RIGHT DISC COVERS THE LIMBUS. IF IT DOES NOT, THE DEVICE HAS A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF SQUEEZING OUT OF THE DEFECT. IN THIS CASE, IT WAS CLEAR BEFORE THE DEVICE WAS RELEASED. A 22 MM ASO MAY HAVE WORKED VERY WELL IN THIS PATIENT."
1327614;1;THE USER ALLEGED THAT WHILE USING THE SYSTEM THERE WAS AN INACCURACY ISSUE. THE USER REPORTED THAT WITH A GOOD REGISTRATION RESULTS (3MM) THE VERIFICATION FOR THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE AND LEFT UPPER LOBE IS NOT PRECISE. THE MC LOOKS PRECISE FOR THE VERIFICATION. THE NAVIGATION TO THE TARGET LOOKS OK ON THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM BUT WHEN DOUBLE CHECKING WITH THE X-RAY IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE NOT AT THE TARGET. THE PHYSICIAN DECIDED TO CANCEL THE PROCEDURE. THE PROCEDURE WAS DONE UNDER FULL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.
1327664;0;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED AN ISSUE WITH THEIR METER. UPON INVESTIGATION, THE METER WAS FOUND TO EXHIBIT  THE MEMORY OVERWRITE MALFUNCTION. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

1333732;1;ON 2008-12-05 WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THE PREFETCHING OF PRIOR EXAMINATIONS FROM THE LONG TERM ARCHIVE (EMC) TO THE SYNGO IMAGING PACS DOES NOT WORK. THAT MEANS THAT THE DOCTORS ARE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE THE COURSE OF DISEASE E.G. OF CANCER PATIENTS BASED ON THE IMAGE DATA FROM PRIOR EXAMINATIONS. USUALLY IMAGE DATA AND REPORT DATA FROM PRIOR EXAMINATION ARE USED TO EVALUATE THE COURSE OF DISEASE COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL EXAMINATION. FIRST ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE IS AN DEFECTIVE BEHAVIOR IN THE DATA TRANSPORT LAYER OF THE NFS (NETWORK FILE SYSTEM) CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LONG TERM ARCHIVE OF EMC AND THE SYNGO IMAGING PACS SYSTEM. SYNGO IMAGING PACS IS ARCHIVING IMAGE DATA VIA THIS NFS INTERFACE ON THE EMC LONG TERM ARCHIVE. AN ERROR ON THE EMC LONG TERM ARCHIVE CAUSED THAT DATA SENT FROM SYNGO IMAGING HAVE BEEN ARCHIVED, BUT THE CONTENT OF THE ARCHIVED FILES (SINGLE IMAGE DATA) WAS SAVED PARTIALLY DEFECTIVE. ON THE PART OF SYNGO IMAGING THERE IS A MECHANISM TO CHECK IF DATA WHICH WAS SENT TO EMC LONG TERM ARCHIVE WAS SAFED EFFECTIVELY. CERTAINLY THIS CHECK DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE CONTACT OF THE SAVED DATA IS CORRECT BUT IF THE FILE SENT IS PRESENT IN THE EMC FILE SYSTEM. THIS EXPANDED CHECK TO CHECK ALSO THE CONTENT OF THE FILES WAS INTRODUCED SINCE (B) (4) SO FAR NO DIRECT CONSEQUENCES ARE REPORTED OR KNOWN. FOLLOWING PREVENTIVE AND CORRECTIVE MEASURES ARE PLANNED: ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSE TOGETHER WITH EMC AND DECISION ABOUT A POSSIBLE SOLUTION VIA A SW PATCH OR CONFIGURATION. DEPENDING FROM #1 ANALYSIS OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMER INSTALLATIONS. CREATION OF A CUSTOMER SAFETY ADVISORY NOTICE FOR ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. IMPLEMENTATION OF A CHECK TOOL TO DETERMINE THE DEFECTIVE SAVED IMAGE DATA ON CUSTOMER SITE. PERFORM THE CHECK ON SITE WITH THE TOOL UNDER #4 TO DETERMINE THE DEFECTIVE SAVED IMAGE DATE. IMPLEMENTATION OF A CORRECTION TOOL TO TEMPORARILY DEARCHIVE THE AFFECTED STUDIES FROM LONG TERM ARCHIVE TO SHORT TERM ARCHIVE. THE TOOL WILL SUBSTITUTE AFFECTED DEFECTIVE IMAGES WITH DUMMY IMAGES. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SERIES WITH DEFECTIVE SINGLE IMAGES WILL BE ABLE TO BE PREFETCHED LATER. PERFORM THE CORRECTION ON SITE WITH THE TOOL UNDER #6 PLANNED. THIS EVENT OCCURED IN (B) (6): HOSPITAL (B) (6), DR. (B) (6).

1344349;0;"(B)(4). THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS WERE DUE TO THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS (RVS) SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED RVS LOTS MADE FROM A PARTICULAR POLYPROPYLENE RESIN LOT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS. ANALYSIS OF THIS RESIN LOT DETERMINED IT HAS UNIQUE COMPOSITIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER RESIN LOTS, WHICH FACILITATED THE BUILD-UP OF STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS. THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS' MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STATIC CHARGE VARIATION ACROSS RV LOTS. OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT CAN GENERATE A STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS INCLUDE LOW HUMIDITY, HANDLING, SHIPPING AND CREATION OF CHARGE WITHIN THE ARCHITECT INSTRUMENTS THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION, ABBOTT HAS IMPLEMENTED STATIC CHARGE TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL INCOMING RV LOTS FROM OUR SUPPLIER. ABBOTT HAS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY OF INCOMING RESIN MATERIAL, AND TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLIER'S MOLDING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL GENERATION OF STATIC CHARGE. THE ACCOUNT IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN PATIENT RESULTS DUE TO ERROR CODE 1007 (UNABLE TO PROCESS TEST, ACTIVATED READ FAILURE) GENERATED ON THE ARCHITECT I2000 ANALYZER.

THE HEATER WIRE CONNECTOR WAS THE SAME AS THAT ON THE EXPIRATORY TUBE. THE 2 DEVICES ARE CURRENTLY EN ROUTE TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, AN EVALUATION IS PROVIDED BASED ON THE EVENT DESCRIPTION. THIS INCIDENT IS SIMILAR TO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED OF INSPIRATORY HEATER WIRE INCORRECTLY OVERMOLDED WITH THE CONNECTOR FOR AN EXPIRATORY HEATER WIRE DURING THE OVERMOLDING PROCESS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRODUCTION PROCESS REVEALED THAT THIS IS DUE TO OPERATOR ERROR DURING PRODUCTION FOR A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS. THE SIZE OF THE BATCH OF BREATHING CIRCUITS PRODUCED IS THEREFORE NOT SIGNIFICANT. WE HAVE MODIFIED OUR PRODUCTION PROCESS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF THIS ISSUE. THE INCORRECT CONNECTORS PREVENT THE CIRCUIT FROM BEING CONNECTED TO THE HUMIDIFIER WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN OPEN CIRCUIT HEATER WIRE SITUATION. THE HUMIDIFIER WOULD THEREFORE ALARM.

1349176;0;THE HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT DURING PREPARATION FOR A CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY, THE HEARTSTRING THE SEAL WAS LOADED PROPERLY INSIDE THE DELIVERY TUBE. THE DELIVERY TUBE WAS PULLED OUT OF THE LOADER AND THE SEAL STAYED BACK IN THE LOADER. THE SEAL DID NOT LOAD INSIDE THE DELIVERY TUBE. ANOTHER TWO HEARTSTRING SEALS WERE USED WITH THE SAME RESULT. THE HEAD NURSE REPORTED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PULL THE DELIVERY TUBE OUT AND SHE FEELS LIKE IF IT GETS STUCK OR CATCHES ON SOMETHING IN THE LOADER DEVICE. A REPLACEMENT SEAL WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUE. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED BY THE HOSPITAL. THIS REPORT IS FOR THE FIRST SEAL. THE DEVICE HAS NOT YET BEEN RETURNED TO CARDIAC SURGERY FOR INVESTIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVICE BEING RETURNED TO CARDIAC SURGERY FOR INVESTIGATION WITH THE CUSTOMER.

1350328;0;THE CUSTOMER STATED ERROR CODE 1007, UNABLE TO PROCESS TEST, ACTIVATED READ FAILURE OCCURRED ON THE ARCHITECT ANALYZER. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION IS IN PROCESS. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS WERE DUE TO THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS (RVS) SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED RVS LOTS MADE FROM A PARTICULAR POLYPROPYLENE RESIN LOT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS. ANALYSIS OF THIS RESIN LOT DETERMINED IT HAS UNIQUE COMPOSITIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER RESIN LOTS, WHICH FACILITATED THE BUILD-UP OF STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS. THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS' MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STATIC CHARGE VARIATION ACROSS RV LOTS. OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT CAN GENERATE A STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS INCLUDE LOW HUMIDITY, HANDLING, SHIPPING AND CREATION OF CHARGE WITHIN THE ARCHITECT INSTRUMENTS THEMSELVES. IN ADDITION, ABBOTT HAS IMPLEMENTED STATIC CHARGE TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL INCOMING RV LOTS FROM OUR SUPPLIER. ABBOTT HAS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY OF INCOMING RESIN MATERIAL, AND TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLIER'S MOLDING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL GENERATION OF STATIC CHARGE. IT WAS REPORTED THE PT EXPIRED. NO CAUSE OF DEATH WAS REPORTED. ADD'L INFO HAS BEEN REQUESTED, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED IF ADD'L INFO BECOMES AVAILABLE. PLEASE SEE MFR REPORT# 3004209178200906060.

1359124;1;IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE CARESUITE FAMILY OF MEDICAL DEVICE DATA SYSTEMS, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MANUAL PATIENT ALLERGY DATA ENTRIES INTO OUR END USER APPLICATION WERE OVERWRITTEN DURING AUTOMATIC UPDATES OF PATIENT DATA FROM THE HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THIS CONFIGURATION CONTRIBUTED TO A PATIENT INCIDENT, RESULTING IN A TEMPORARY ALLERGIC REACTION (SHORTNESS OF BREATH) TO A PRESCRIBED MEDICATION ORDER OF TORADOL. THE INCIDENT WAS MITIGATED THROUGH NORMAL CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO PROCEED WITH THEIR SCHEDULED SURGERY, WITHOUT FURTHER EFFECTS. AN IMPROPER CONFIGURATION OF THE INTERFACE DATABASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, BY ALLOWING AUTOMATIC THIRD PARTY HIS/CIS UPDATES TO THE END USER APPLICATION, WHERE MANUAL UPDATES ARE IN PRACTICE. CUSTOMERS PREFERRING THIS PRACTICE SHOULD NOT LINK THE INTERFACE DATABASE TO THEIR HIS/CIS. THE REPORTING CUSTOMER SITE HAS BEEN RECONFIGURED TO SUPPORT THEIR PREFERRED PRACTICE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER REPORTS OF ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE. NONETHELESS, DURING THE COURSE OF OUR CURRENT INVESTIGATION WE'VE RECEIVED ONE ADDITIONAL SITE REPORT OF ALLERGY DATA BEING OVERWRITTEN. OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE REPORTED INCIDENT REVOLVED AROUND HOW OUR MEDICAL DEVICE DATA SYSTEM INTERFACES WORK IN POPULATING CARESUITE END USER APPLICATIONS WITH HIS/CIS DATA. THE CARESUITE FAMILY APPLICATIONS ARE DELIVERED WITH 'STANDARD' LINKED ALLERGY FIELDS. BY DEFAULT, THESE FIELDS ARE CONFIGURED TO IMPORT DATA FROM OTHER VENDOR SYSTEMS, AND/OR TO TRANSFER DATA WITHIN THE CARESUITE APPLICATIONS. WHEN IMPLEMENTING THESE APPLICATIONS, SITES MUST DECIDE WHETHER THE HIS OR CARESUITE IS THE MASTER OF THE ALLERGY AND PRECAUTION DATA. DATA MUST NOT BE ENTERED THROUGH BOTH SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA. THE SITUATION IS THAT PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FIELDS FOR ALLERGIES AND PRECAUTIONS CAN BE ENTERED INTO CARE SUITE APPLICATIONS IN TWO WAYS: LOCALLY BY THE END USER OR EXTERNALLY VIA AN HIS/ADT INTERFACE. OUR METHODOLOGY IS THAT THE HIS IS THE DEFAULT MASTER. THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO IS POSSIBLE: PATIENT IS BOOKED TO GO INTO THE OR. IN THE PREOP APPLICATION, THE PRE OP NURSE ENTERS AN ALLERGY. PATIENT RECORD IS STARTED IN ANESTHESIA AND THE ADT INTERFACE DOWNLOADS ALLERGY INFORMATION FROM THE HIS. IF THE INFORMATION IS THE SAME, THEN THERE IS NO PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IF THE HIS ALLERGY FIELD IS BLANK OR DIFFERENT, IT WILL OVERWRITE THE END USER ALLERGY FIELD ENTERED IN THE PREOP APPLICATION (E.G. REMOVE AN UPDATED ALLERGY, LEAVE IT BLANK OR DIFFERENT). IT IS CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM TO PREVENT THIS, AND MANY CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE HIS IS THE MASTER BY DEFAULT, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS TO OCCUR. THROUGH OUR CLINICAL TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTATION, PICIS REVIEW WITH CUSTOMERS HOW THEY WANT TO CONFIGURE ALLERGIES. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES THE FACT THAT INTERFACE DATA FROM AN HIS WILL OVERWRITE THE DATA ENTERED INTO OUR APPLICATIONS. MOST CUSTOMERS DECIDE NOT TO BRING ALLERGIES IN THROUGH THE INTERFACE DATABASE. HOWEVER, IF THE ALLERGY FIELDS ARE NOT DE-LINKED FROM THE INTERFACE, THE DESCRIBED SCENARIO IS POSSIBLE. IN DEVELOPING OUR CORRECTIVE ACTION STRATEGY, WE HAVE REVIEWED CUSTOMER CONFIGURATION PROFILES, AND EVALUATED THE LEVEL OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USAGE MODELS. THROUGH MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF CUSTOMER CONFIGURATIONS, PICIS HAS DEVELOPED A STRATEGY FOR RECOMMENDED SYSTEM INTERFACE RECONFIGURATION, TO MEET OUR CUSTOMER NEEDS. TO HELP ENSURE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CONFIGURATION AND INTEGRITY OF PATIENT DATA, WE HAVE INITIATED A CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION TO OUR INSTALLED BASE, EXPLAINING THE POTENTIAL SOURCE OF PATIENT DATA CONFLICT AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IN CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE CONFIGURATION OPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION.

1360248;1;CERNER DISTRIBUTED A PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION IN EARLY 2009 TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES. THE SOFTWARE NOTIFICATION INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND INTERIM WORKFLOW ADJUSTMENT TO PREVENT THE MALFUNCTION. A SOFTWARE IS BEING DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE FOR ALL THE SITES THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY IMPACTED. CERNER CORPORATION WILL PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WHEN THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION IS AVAILABLE. THIS ISSUE INVOLVES THE SURESCRIPT ERX FUNCTIONALITY IN POWERORDERS AND AFFECTS USERS THAT UTILIZE POWERORDERS ELECTRONIC ROUTING TO DOCUMENT PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION ORDERS. WHEN AN UPDATE IS MADE TO THE FREQUENCY FIELD ON AN EXISTING PRESCRIPTION, THE FREQUENCY SCHEDULE ID IS NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY UPDATED ON NEW ORDERS SENT TO THE PHARMACY VIA SURESCRIPTS. A PATIENT COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE A MEDICATION TOO FREQUENTLY OR INFREQUENTLY IF THE PHARMACY RECEIVES AN ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION WITH THE WRONG FREQUENCY. CERNER RECEIVED NOTIFICATION THAT TWO PATIENTS RECEIVED MORE THAN THE PRESCRIBED DOSAGE OF MEDICATION AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. THE FIRST, AN ELDERLY PATIENT, WAS REPORTED TO HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF A BLOOD THINNER LEVOXYL FOR 6 WEEKS. NO SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CERNER IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS ISSUE. A SECOND PATIENT EVENT WAS REPORTED WHERE THE PATIENT RECEIVED INAPPROPRIATE DOSAGE ORDERS FOR CARBAMAZEPINE AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH ATYPICAL CHEST PAINS. THE CLIENT SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED THE PATIENT TOOK THE CORRECT DOSAGE BASED ON PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS AND DID NOT RELY ON THE INAPPROPRIATE DOSAGE AS INDICATED IN THE SURESCRIPTS PRESCRIPTION MESSAGE.
1360396;1;"THE ABACUS DATABASE REVEALED THAT THIS FACILITY HAS TWO TEMPLATES FOR STOCK FORMULAS FOR NEONATAL PT TYPES; STOCK TPN SOLUTION AND UAC NEONATAL SOLUTION. THE FLUIDS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED VOLUMES ON THESE TEMPLATES ARE LOCKED AND CANNOT BE CHANGED DURING THE ORDER ENTRY PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THIS FACILITY HAS CREATED TWO PTS WITHIN ABACUS CALLED 'STOCK TPN' AND 'UAC SOLUTION' AND ASSIGNED THEM TO THE NEONATAL PT TYPE. THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT THE PHARMACIST, WHO ENTERED THE SUBJECT ORDER, SELECTED THE CORRECT PT, UAC SOLUTION, BUT THEN MISTAKENLY SELECTED THE STOCK TPN SOLUTION TEMPLATE INSTEAD OF THE UAC NEONATAL SOLUTION TEMPLATE. THE ABACUS FORMULA LABEL AND BAG LABEL FOR THE SUBJECT ORDER INDICATED THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE BAG CONTAINED THE FLUIDS AND VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STOCK TPN SOLUTION TEMPLATE. HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT IDENTIFIED UNTIL INFUSION. BASED ON AN EVAL OF THE DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ABACUS SOFTWARE PERFORMED AS DESIGNED AND PRODUCED THE SOLUTION AS ORDERED. TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF THIS INCIDENT, THE FACILITY WORKED WITH BAXA TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO CREATE TWO NEW PT TYPES; STOCK TPN SOLN AND UAC NEONATAL SOLN. THE APPROPRIATE TEMPLATES AND PTS WERE LINKED TO THESE NEW PT TYPES. NOW WHEN THEN STAFF IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ONE OF THESE SOLUTIONS, THE PHARMACIST WILL SELECT THE 'STOCK TPN' OR 'UAC SOLUTION' PT, AND ONLY THE APPROPRIATE TEMPLATE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ORDER. ON (B)(6) 2009, BAXA WAS NOTIFIED BY THE CUSTOMER OF A PT INVOLVED INCIDENT USING THE ABACUS V2.0 TPN CALCULATING SOFTWARE FOR UAC SOLUTIONS. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE USED TO HELP KEEP UMBILICAL ARTERY CATHETER LINES OPEN AND FUNCTIONING. THIS FACILITY'S UAC SOLUTIONS CONTAIN TROPHAMINE, STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION, SODIUM ACETATE AND HEPARIN. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS PT RECEIVED A BAG CONTAINING AN INCORRECT SOLUTION (TROPHAMINE, STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION, DEXTROSE 70%, CALCIUM GLUCONATE AND HEPARIN). DURING INFUSION, THE UMBILICAL ARTERY LINE BECAME CLOTTED BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH HEPARIN IN THE SOLUTION. THE NURSING STAFF IDENTIFIED THE INCORRECT SOLUTION AND TERMINATED THE INFUSION. BLOOD SUGARS TAKEN FROM THE LINE WERE 600 PLUS, BUT THE BLOOD SUGARS FROM THIS PT'S HEEL STICK INDICATED 84. THE PT WAS GIVEN A NEW IV LINE AND UAC SOLUTION. THE PT'S CURRENT STATUS IS STABLE WITH NO APPARENT LONG-TERM INJURY OR ILLNESS RESULTING FROM THIS CASE."

1364756;0;"A MALE WITH A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION, UNDERWENT ENDOVASCULAR THERAPY IN 2009. THE PATIENT WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR. THE PATIENT HAD ABDOMINAL, THORACIC, AS WELL AS RIGHT AND LEFT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY ANEURYSMS. A STENT GRAFT MADE BY THE PHYSICIAN WAS PLACED AT THORACIC ANEURYSM AND ZENITH DEVICES WERE UTILIZED FOR THE ABDOMINAL ANEURYSM. THE CONTRALATERAL INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY WAS NOT EMBOLIZED BY COILS, BUT TWO ILIAC LEG GRAFTS WERE PLACED THROUGH COMMON ILIAC ARTERY INTO THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. AFTER ONE ILIAC LEG WAS PLACED ON THE IPSILATERAL SIDE, ENDOLEAK CAUSED BY REGURGITATION WAS CONFIRMED. THE ENDOLEAK FLOWED BACK FROM THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY INTO THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. THEN, ONE MORE ILIAC LEG GRAFT WAS PLACED AT THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY OF THE IPSILATERAL SIDE WITHOUT COIL EMBOLIZING OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. A PROXIMAL TYPE I ENDOLEAK WAS THEN CONFIRMED (1820334-2009-00234) AND PART OF CONTRALATERAL ILIAC LEG GRAFT WAS STENOSED (1820334-2009-00235) AFTER PLACING THE MAIN BODY AND ILIAC LEG GRAFTS. THE TYPE I ENDOLEAK WAS RESOLVED BY PLACING ANOTHER MANUFACTURER'S STENT. THE STENOSIS OF THE CONTRALATERAL ILIAC LEG GRAFT WAS BALLOONED. THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERED AND ABDOMINAL DISTENSION WERE CONFIRMED AT NIGHT. A RUPTURE OF THE LEFT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY WAS FOUND WHEN OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR WAS PERFORMED. THE LEFT AND AMP; RIGHT INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY AND INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY WERE CLAMPED BY SURGICAL OPERATION. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT HE FELT THAT THE STENOSIS WAS CAUSED BY CALCIFICATION. COLLATERALS FROM PERIPHERY OF THE LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY INTO THE LEFT INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY CAUSED BLOOD FLOW TO THE LEFT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN FELT THE RUPTURE WAS CAUSED BY PRESSURE OF THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE ANEURYSM OF THE LEFT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. PATIENT HAS RECOVERED. INVESTIGATION EVALUATION: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZENITH DEVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED; ALL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION ACTIVITIES SHOWING THE DEVICE MEETS THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS MEET THE NEEDS OF THE USER. EACH DEVICE IS SHIPPED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) LISTING THE INDICATIONS FOR USE, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, AND THE CORRECT DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE. THE INVESTIGATED TREND IS ""NOT A REJECT-NO DEFECT"". BASED ON THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE USER, AND THE LACK OF FILMS TO REVIEW, THE EVENT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE STENT GRAFT AND CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AT THIS TIME. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THIS EVENT, SPECIFICALLY THE RUPTURE, WAS RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STENT GRAFT. FOR UNKNOWN REASONS THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT EMBOLIZE EITHER INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERIES PRIOR TO COVERING THEM WITH THE LEG EXTENSIONS. DEPENDING ON PATIENT SPECIFIC ANATOMICAL CONDITIONS, THIS COULD LEAD TO A TYPE 2 ENDOLEAK ON EITHER SIDE. BASED ON THE REPORTED EVENT, THIS APPEARED TO BE THE CASE, THERE WAS BACK FLOW FROM THE INTERNAL ILIAC ON THE IPSILATERAL SIDE AFTER THE ARTERY WAS COVERED. AS THE USER NOTED, THIS BACK FLOW MAY HAVE INCREASED THE PRESSURE SUBSEQUENTLY RUPTURING THE LEFT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. TYPICALLY, IT IS COMMON FOR THE INTERNAL ILIAC(S) TO BE EMBOLIZED PRIOR TO BEING COVERED BY THE STENT GRAFT. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOTIFIED THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR SIMILAR EVENTS."

1367154;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING AN UNK PROCEDURE, THE DEVICE WOULD NOT ACTIVATE AFTER 5 MINUTES OF USE. ANOTHER DEVICE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE TO THE PT. EVAL SUMMARY: THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE BLADE SCRATCHED AND CRACKED. DURING FUNCTIONAL TESTING, AN ERROR CODE 5 WAS DISPLAYED AND THE BLADE TIP FURTHER CRACKED. THE DEVICE WILL STOP ACTIVATING, AND EITHER EMIT A SOLID TONE OR DISPLAY AN INSTRUMENT ERROR CODE 5 OR A SOLID TONE ON THE GENERATOR DISPLAY WHEN THE BLADE BECOMES DAMAGED. WHEN A BLADE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED SUCH AS SCRATCHED OR CRACKED, AND TITANIUM METAL IS FATIGUED WHEN CONTINUALLY ENERGIZED AND THIS RESULTS IN THE BLADE FURTHER CRACKING AND POSSIBLY BREAKING OFF. A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF AN ERROR CODE 5 (INSTRUMENT ERROR) IS BLADE DAMAGE. BLADE DAMAGE MAY OCCUR FROM EXTERNAL CONTACT WITH METAL OR PLASTIC DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE. EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT, AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT THIS PROCESS. COMPLAINT INFO IS TRENDED ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. THE BATCH HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MFR, BUT ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE IS NOT YET COMPLETED.
1371605;0;THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED AND THE EVALUATION IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW REVEALED NOTHING RELEVANT TO THIS EVENT. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSES OF THIS TYPE OF EVENT ARE TYPICALLY CAUSED BY FLEXION/EXTENSION OF THE JOINT OR LEVERAGING OF THE HOOK WHILE THE HOOK IS STILL IN THE BONE TUNNEL. THIS IS THE FIRST COMPLAINT OF THIS TYPE FOR THIS PART/LOT COMBINATION. THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF THIS EVENT ARE BEING COMMUNICATED TO THE EVENT REPORTER. IF THE ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION IS OBTAINED FROM THE EVALUATION, A FOLLOW UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHILE THE SURGEON WAS PULLING OUT THE TRANSFIX HOOK THAT ATTACHES TO THE GUIDE, THE TOP PORTION OF THE TRANSFIX HOOK BROKE WITHIN THE REMOVAL TUNNEL. THE SURGEON WAS ABLE TO INSERT A SCOPE IN THE KNEE SPACE TO CONFIRM THAT THE BROKEN PORTION OF THE TRANSFIX HOOK WAS LODGED IN THE KNEE SPACE. THE HOOK WAS NOT RETRIEVED. THE SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. NO FURTHER PATIENT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT OR MADE AVAILABLE IN RESPONSE TO FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION. NO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM THIS EVENT. THIS DEVICE IS USED FOR TREATMENT.
1371670;1;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THEY CAME ACROSS AN EPISODE YESTERDAY OF THE MON/WED/FRI SCHEDULE NOT ABLE TO BE CHARTED AGAINST. THE STAFF STATED THAT THEY HAD TROUBLE WITH ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ORDER SET AND HAVE NEEDED TO RE-ORDER WITH EVERY SECOND DOSE. WHEN THE ORDER IS STORED, IT IS STORED WITH A NEXT SCHEDULE TIME THAT IS 24 HOURS TOO EARLY. THE INITIAL EVALUATION OF THIS REPORT SUPPORTS THAT MEDICATION ORDERS ENTERED THROUGH THIS SOFTWARE IN SOME TIME ZONES WILL NOT APPEAR IN THE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORDS (MAR).

PHILIPS IS IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS EVENT AND THE COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SENT ONCE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED.
1371946;0;AN ANEURX STENT GRAFT SYSTEM WAS INSERTED IN A PT FOR THE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT OF AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM. ANEURYSM MORPHOLOGY WAS NOT REPORTED AND THE VESSELS WERE MILDLY TORTUOUS BILATERALLY. THERE WAS A LOT OF FOCAL DISEASE BILATERALLY MORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAN THE LEFT, BUT THIS WAS NOT SEEN BEFORE THE PROCEDURE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INSERT DILATORS FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DILATED FIRST WITH A 16 FR DILATOR AND THEN WITH AN 18 FR. WHILE THE 18 FR DILATOR WAS BEING INSERTED THE BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NOTED TO HAVE DROPPED. A WIRE WAS PREVIOUSLY INSERTED UP THE RIGHT SIDE AND THIS WAS USED TO INSERT A RELIANT BALLOON. THE BALLOON WAS INFLATED IN THE AORTA TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING. A RETROGRADE INJECTION WAS SHOT AND SHOWED THE LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY AT THE JUNCTION OF HYPOGASTRIC ARTERY WAS DISSECTED. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED TO CONTINUE WITH THE ENDOVASCULAR PROCEDURE AND INSERTED AN ANEURX STENT GRAFT. THE AORTIC NECK MEASURED 29 TO 30 MM IN DIAMETER AND HAD A FOCAL AREA OF 26 MM. DURING THE INSERTION OF THE ANEURX IT KINKED AND IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE PT. ANOTHER ANEURX BIFURCATED STENT GRAFT WAS INSERTED AND SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED. THE DISSECTED VESSEL WAS COVERED WITH 2 ILIAC STENT GRAFTS. PROXIMAL TO THAT A 20 MM CUFF WAS IMPLANTED DUE TO THE SIZE ON THE VESSEL WHICH WAS LARGER IN THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. NO ADDITIONAL CLINICAL SEQUELAE WERE REPORTED AND THE PATIENT IS FINE. OTHER (REQUIRED SECONDARY INTERVENTION). EVALUATION RESULTS: TORTUOUS AND DISEASED ILIAC ARTERIES. DILATOR. CONCLUSION: TORTUOUS AND DISEASED ILIAC ARTERIES. DILATOR. EVALUATION SUMMARY: THERE WERE MULTIPLE KINKS ON THE CATHETER AT 117MM, 135MM AND 145MM. THE AREA BETWEEN 135 AND 145 WAS ACCORDIONED. THE STENT GRAFT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE LAB WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE DID NOT DETERMINE ANY ABNORMALITY. THE KINKS WERE DETERMINED TO BE DUE VESSEL MORPHOLOGY.

EVALUATION: OTHER, MICROBIAL TESTING OF OPENED/UNOPENED REAGENTS AND RETENTION LOTS. EVALUATION RESULTS: OTHER, WBC REAGENT PART A (LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2). THE CELL-DYN 4000 AND CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZERS WERE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED WBC BACKGROUND COUNTS IN THE FIELD. BACKGROUND COUNTS WERE RECOVERING UP TO 0.5 X 103/UL .THE SPECIFICATION FOR WBC BACKGROUND READINGS IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.10X103/UL PER THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE OPERATOR'S MANUAL, AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL. BACKGROUNDS COUNTS MUST BE WITHIN SPECIFICATION PRIOR TO REPORTING OF PATIENT SAMPLES. IF THE OPERATOR PROCEEDS TO RUN PATIENT SAMPLES WITH BACKGROUND COUNTS OUT OF SPECIFICATION, RESULTS MAY EXHIBIT FLUORESCENT PARTICLE FLAGGING, FLUORESCENT CHANNEL 3 FLAGS, RESISTANT RBC FLAGS, INCREASED NUCLEATED RBC FLAGS OR ABNORMAL WBC HISTOGRAM SCATTER PLOTS. IF PRODUCT LABELING IS NOT FOLLOWED AND PATIENT RESULTS ARE REPORTED, WBC RESULTS MAY BE INACCURATE AND HIGHER THAN ACTUAL RESULTS; HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PATIENT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE DETECTED MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION IN THE WBC REAGENT PART A, WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED FOR USE WITH THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS IDENTIFIED ONLY ON LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2 OF WBC REAGENT PART A. THE CONTAMINANT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO BE PSEUDOMONAS SPECIES, AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATE COMMON IN BIO-FILMS, AND DOES NOT PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION, SPORADIC IN NATURE, CAN AFFECT OTHER LOTS OF WBC REAGENT PART A, AS MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WITHIN THE WBC REAGENT PART A CAN FURTHER CONTAMINATE THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEMS. THE SOURCE OF THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF FILTRATION OF WATER USED FOR CLEANING PROCEDURES, BIOFILM SHEDDING IN THE FILL LINE, INCREASED BIOBURDEN DUE TO STAGNANT ZONES IN THE FILL-LINE AREA AND FAILURE TO ACCURATELY DETECT CONTAMINATION AS PART OF PRODUCT RELEASE. THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION: - ALL THREE AFFECTED LOTS WERE RECALLED FROM THE FIELD AND CUSTOMERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO DECONTAMINATE THEIR INSTRUMENTS PRIOR TO USING ANY NEW WBC REAGENT PART A. - INCORPORATION OF AN IMPROVED MICROBIAL TESTING METHOD INTO THE CURRENT PROCESS. - INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SANITIZATION IN THE FILL-LINE AREA, INCLUDING FILTRATION OF THE WATER USED FOR CLEANING-IN-PLACE PROCEDURES. - INCREASED FLUSHING OF THE FILL-LINE EQUIPMENT AND AUTOCLAVING OF FILL-LINE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS NOZZLES. COMPLETION OF THE FINAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE END OF 4TH QUARTER 2008. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ONLY IN WBC PART A REAGENT, FOR LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2 AND 56675I2; HOWEVER, IF THE INSTRUMENT IS NOT PROPERLY DECONTAMINATED, THE CONTAMINATED WBC REAGENT PART A HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS AND CAN THEN BACK-CONTAMINATE OTHER BOTTLES OF WBC REAGENT PART A PLACED ON THE CONTAMINATED INSTRUMENT. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT. THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (FSR) NOTICED A PINK-ORANGE FILM IN THE WBC A REAGENT INLET TUBING ON THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZER. ADDITIONALLY, THE WBC BACKGROUNDS WERE OUT OF RANGE HIGH AND THE QUALITY CONTROL WAS FAILING WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF FLUORESCENT PARTICLES. THE FSR DISCUSSED THE CONTAMINATION ISSUE WITH THE CUSTOMER, REPLACED THE WBC A REAGENT LINE AND SYRINGE, AND DECONTAMINATED THE ANALYZER. NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT WAS REPORTED."

1386137;0;EVALUATION: CONCLUSION: AN INVESTIGATION WAS OPENED TO EVALUATE A COMPLAINT TREND ASSOCIATED WITH LENS TEARS. POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES FOR LENS TEARS INCLUDE BOTH DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES AND POSSIBLE HANDLING ERRORS BY THE CUSTOMER. TO ADDRESS DELIVERY SYSTEM ISSUES, ALL STAGES IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE INJECTORS AND CARTRIDGES WERE REVIEWED AND REVISED AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WERE REVEALED. TO ADDRESS HANDLING ERRORS, ALL INJECTOR/CARTRIDGE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU) HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO ADD FURTHER CLARIFICATION TO INSTRUCT THE USERS IN THE PROPER DELIVERY TECHNIQUES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE, AND MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING THE LENS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE +21.5 DIOPTER CC4204BF COLLAMER PLATE LENS WAS TORN BY THE INJECTOR AS IT WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THE EYE. THE LENS WAS EJECTED OUT UNTO THE FIELD. THERE WAS NO PATIENT CONTACT. THE CUSTOMER WAS INSTRUCTED TO TRY A NEW INJECTOR AND IT RESOLVED THE ISSUE.

1386183;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING. IT WAS LATER CONFIRMED THAT THE SCREEN WOULD FREEZE AT THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN, WHICH IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE HANDHELD COMPUTER MODEL THAT WAS HAVING THE ISSUE. THE EVENT WAS NOT RESOLVED WITH NORMAL TROUBLESHOOTING, AND THERE IS NO INFO TO DATE THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.
1386186;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE COULD NOT EXPORT DATA AS TEXT FROM THE HANDHELD. IT SAID THAT DATABASE WAS EMPTY. HOWEVER, THE FLASHCARD FILES WERE SENT OVER TO MANUFACTURER AND THEY WERE SUCCESSFULLY CONVERTED, BUT IT IS UNKNOWN WHY THE HANDHELD WAS NOT ABLE TO CONVERT THE FILES VIA THE FLASHCARD READER. THE FILES WERE NOT CORRUPTED AND THE DATA WAS ABLE TO BE RETRIEVED SUCCESSFULLY IN HOUSE.
1386188;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS HAVING SCREEN FREEZING ISSUES. IT WAS REPORTED THAT IT WAS SUSPECTED TO BE ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINED 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE NURSE AT THE SITE WAS ASKED TO RESEAT THE FLASHCARD SINCE SCREEN FREEZES WERE A KNOWN EVENT WITH X5 AND 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE NURSE WAS UNABLE TO GET FLASHCARD BACK OUT OF THE HANDHELD COMPUTER. IT WAS ATTEMPTED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE.

CERNER CORPORATION WILL ISSUE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WHEN THE SOFTWARE CORRECTION IS AVAILABLE. THE ISSUE INVOLVES THE POTENTIAL DUPLICATION OF UNIT NUMBERS WITHIN CERNER CLASSIC PATHNET BLOOD BANK DONOR AND AFFECTS SITES THAT START OVER EACH YEAR WITH THEIR LAB UNIT NUMBERS (FOR EXAMPLE, SITES THAT USE A RANGE OF NUMBERS SUCH AS 00001-29999 FOR BOTH 2008 AND 2009). BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE CURRENTLY ONLY VALIDATES AGAINST THE LAST SIX DIGITS OF THE UNIT NUMBER, WHICH IS NOT A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER ACROSS DIFFERENT COLLECTION YEARS, THERE CAN BE INSTANCES WHERE THE SOFTWARE DISPLAYS RESULTS FOR UNITS DRAWN THE PREVIOUS YEAR RATHER THAN THE RESULTS FOR UNITS FROM THE CURRENT YEAR THAT SHARE THE SAME LAST SIX DIGITS. THE UNITS FROM THE CURRENT YEAR SHOULD NOT HAVE A RESULT VALUE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN ENTERED BY THE USER, BUT INSTEAD THE SOFTWARE IS PICKING UP THE RESULT VALUE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF ANY ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT A DONOR UNIT WITH POSITIVE TEST RESULTS COULD BE REPORTED AS HAVING NEGATIVE TESTING BASED ON THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUSLY DRAWN UNITS WITH THE SAME LAST SIX DIGITS IF A SITE CONTINUES TO USE DUPLICATE UNIT NUMBERS. THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE, WHEREBY A NEGATIVE RESULT COULD BE DISPLAYED AS BEING POSITIVE.
1387532;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS THERAPY HANDHELD COMPUTER SCREEN FROZE DURING TWICE NORMAL MODE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE TEST WOULD EVENTUALLY COMPLETE AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE TEST AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCT FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. .
1387877;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO THEIR MANUFACTURING CONSULTANT THAT THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER SCREEN KEPT FREEZING. THE COMPUTER CONTAINED 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. A HARD RESET AND A SOFT RESET WERE PERFORMED. A FLASHCARD REINSERTION WAS ALSO PERFORMED. THE SCREEN DISPLAYED, FROZEN ON ERROR XQ NEW APPLICATION NOT INSTALLED. THE PRODUCT IS AT THE MANUFACTURER PENDING COMPLETION OF PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1391964;0;THE CUSTOMER CALLED FOR HELP WITH HER CONTOUR METER. WHILE TROUBLESHOOTING, SHE PERFORMED CONTROL TESTS AND RECEIVED A RESULT OF 186 MG/DL. THE NORMAL CONTROL RANGE WAS 102-141 MG/DL. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ALLEGED. THE TEST STRIPS ARE TO BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. REPLACEMENT TEST STRIPS WERE SENT TO THE CUSTOMER.
1392531;0;THE REPORTER STATED THE SURGEON IMPLANTED A 12.5MM ICM125V4 IMPLANTABLE COLLAMER LENS IN 2009, IN THE PT'S RIGHT (OD) EYE. THE LENS WAS EXPLANTED ON THE SAME DAY, DUE TO THE PT HAVING DEVELOPED A HEADACHE DUE TO ELEVATED IOP. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PT DEVELOPED NARROWING OF THE ANGLE, ANGLE CLOSURE AND SHALLOWING OF THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER. THE LENS WAS NOT EXCHANGED FOR A SHORTER LENS. SECONDARY SURGERY.
1392678;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A SHOULDER SCOPE, THE ABLATION PROBE SPARKED AS THE SURGEON WAS PLACING IT INTO THE PATIENT; THE SPARK CAUSED A SUPERFICIAL BURN ON THE PATIENT'S SKIN. FOLLOW-UP WITH THE REPORTER PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT THE PATIENT IS FINE; NO TREATMENT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE BURN. IT WAS ALSO STATED IN FOLLOW-UP THAT A FOOT CONTROL WAS BEING USED WITH THE ABLATOR IN THE CASE, BUT IT WAS NOT ACTUATED AT THE TIME OF ABLATOR SPARKED. THE SURGEON PICKED UP THE ABLATION PROBE, STARTED TO PUT IT IN THE PATIENT INCISION, AND THE PROBE SPARKED WITHOUT HITTING ANYTHING. IT WAS REPORTED THAT NO OTHER CONCOMITANT DEVICES/EQUIPMENT WERE CONTACTING THE COMPLAINANT DEVICE. THE PROBE CAUSED A SUPERFICIAL BURN ON THE PATIENT'S SKIN. THE SURGEON DISCONTINUED USE OF THAT PROBE. THE CASE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. THE CONSOLE SETTING WAS: 8, VACUUM MODE: ON, IRRIGANT: LACTATED RINGERS, ALARMS: NONE, CANNULA USED: NONE, SURGICAL POSITIONING FOR PATIENT: LATERAL. NO FURTHER PATIENT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT OR MADE AVAILABLE IN RESPONSE TO FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION. NO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM THIS EVENT. THIS DEVICE IS USED FOR TREATMENT. THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED FOR EVALUATION. THE COMPLAINT WAS NOT CONFIRMED; THE EVENT COULD NOT BE RECREATED. THE RETURNED PROBE MET SPECIFICATIONS; IT WAS TESTED AND OBSERVED TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, ARCING ONLY WHEN ITS BUTTONS WERE ACTIVATED. THE REPORTED ACCESSORIES AND SETTINGS WERE COMPATIBLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR THIS DEVICE. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW REVEALED NOTHING RELEVANT TO THIS EVENT. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND DEVICE EVALUATION, THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THIS TYPE OF EVENT IS PREMATURE USER ACTIVATION OF THE DEVICE OUTSIDE OF THE INCISION/JOINT SPACE. THIS IS THE FIRST COMPLAINT OF THIS TYPE FOR THIS PART/LOT COMBINATION. THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THIS EVENT IS BEING COMMUNICATED TO THE EVENT REPORTER. IF ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION IS OBTAINED FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S EVALUATION, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED."
1392870;0;IN 2006--PATIENT UNDERWENT OPEN VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIR WITH MESH IMPLANT. CURRENTLY, PATIENT HAS PAIN IN THE AREA OF THE INCISION SITE AND POSSIBLE RECURRENCE. REPORT INDICATES THAT THE PATIENT MAY HAVE A RECURRENCE, WHICH IS A KNOWN POSSIBLE ADVERSE EVENT LISTED IN THE IFU. THE REPORT DOES NOT SPECIFY A SPECIFIC PRODUCT PROBLEM AND NO PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION, THEREFORE, BASED ON THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT A FAILURE IN THE DEVICE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. WE WILL SUBMIT A FOLLOW UP REPORT WHEN/IF PRODUCT IS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.
1393104;0;DURING A POPLITEAL PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY WITH BRACHYTHERAPY, A PIECE OF THE GLIDE CATHETER BROKE OFF IN THE PATIENT'S LEFT FEMORAL ARTERY. A GUIDE WIRE WAS IN THE LEFT FEMORAL ARTERY AND A 65CM GLIDE CATHETER WAS INSERTED OVER THE WIRE. WHEN THE PHYSICIAN TRIED TO REMOVE THE GLIDE CATHETER OVER THE WIRE THE GLIDE CATHETER HUNG UP AND BECAME DIFFICULT TO REMOVE. THE GLIDE CATHETER BROKE OFF INSIDE THE PATIENT. THE SURGEON HAD TO PERFORM A CUTDOWN TO OBTAIN THE FOREIGN BODY AND PROCEEDED WITH ORIGINAL PROCEDURE.
1393232;0;PATIENT WAS REVISED TO ADDRESS INFECTION. NO PRODUCTS WERE RETURNED. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES. A SEARCH OF THE COMPLAINT DATABASE DID NOT SHOW ANY OTHER REPORTS AGAINST THE MANUFACTURING LOTS. THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE REPORTED INFECTION. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND SUGGESTING PRODUCT ERROR WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AND THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION IS NOT INDICATED. DEPUY CONSIDERS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSED AT THIS TIME. SHOULD THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BE RECEIVED, THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE RE-OPENED.
1393430;0;IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION THAT WHILE PREPARING FOR A PROCEDURE INVOLVING A PROLIEVE THERMODILATATION KIT , A LEAK WAS DETECTED WHILE TESTING THE ANCHORING BALLOON. THE LEAK WAS IN THE ANCHORING BALLOON. THIS EVENT OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE PATIENT. THEY OPENED A NEW KIT AND COMPLETED THE PROCEDURE WITH NO ISSUES. PRODUCT ANALYSIS SUMMARY THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED, THERE WAS A PROBLEM FOUND WITH THE CATHETER. THE DISTAL BOND ON THE ANCHORING BALLOON WAS DELAMINATED AND WATER WAS LEAKING FROM THE DELAMINATED BOND. THIS FAILURE MODE IS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.
1394134;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING REMOVAL OF A WOUND DRAIN, THE DRAIN BROKE OFF IN THE PT. THE PT HAD TO BE TAKEN BACK TO OR TO RETRIEVE THE BROKEN PIECE. NO FURTHER COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. NO SAMPLE WAS RETURNED FOR EVAL, THE SAMPLE WAS DISCARDED AT THE HOSPITAL. THIS DRAIN IS RECEIVED FROM A SUPPLIER AND THE INCOMING QA PERSONNEL PERFORM VISUAL INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO TEARS ON DRAIN HOLES AND ALSO PERFORM A BREAK STRENGTH TEST. AS A FINISHED GOOD, QA PERFORMS RANDOM VISUAL INSPECTIONS FOR DAMAGED COMPONENTS. THE INCOMING RECORDS FOR WOUND DRAINS MANUFACTURED FOR THE PAST 24 MONTHS WERE REVIEWED AND THOSE RECORDS DID NOT SHOW ANY REJECTS RELATED TO TENSILE VALUES. ALL VALUES WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE ABOVE THOSE SPECIFIED IN THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR SURGICAL DRAINS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MANUFACTURING ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED PROBLEM. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE STATE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF DRAIN DAMAGE OR BREAKAGE: ""ADDITIONAL PERFORATIONS SHOULD NOT BE MADE IN THE DRAINS. AVOID SUTURING THROUGH DRAINS. DRAINS SHOULD LIE FLAT AND IN LINE WITH THE SKIN EXIT AREAS. PARTICULAR CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AVOID ANY OBSTACLES TO THE DRAIN EXIT PATH. DRAINS SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR FREE MOTION DURING CLOSURE TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF BREAKAGE. DRAIN REMOVAL SHOULD BE DONE GENTLY BY HAND. DRAINS SHOULD NOT BE HANDLED WITH POINTED, TOOTHED OR SHARP INSTRUMENTS WHICH COULD CAUSE CUTS OR NICKS AND LEAD TO SUBSEQUENT STRUCTURAL FAILURE OF THE DRAIN. SURGICAL REMOVAL MAY BE NECESSARY IF DRAIN IS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE OR BREAKS""."
1394295;0;"A PATIENT WAS UNDERGOING A LUNG BIOPSY PROCEDURE USING A CT SYSTEM FOR IMAGE ACQUISITION. IN THIS PROCEDURE, THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) POSITIONS THE NEEDLE TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CT SCAN ABORTED AT SOME POINT DURING THE PROCEDURE. DESPITE THE INABILITY TO ACQUIRE FURTHER IMAGES, THE HCP CONTINUED WITH THE BIOPSY. AFTER THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED, THE HCP DISCOVERED THAT THE PATIENT SUSTAINED PNEUMOTHORAX. THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED AND HAD HER LUNGS RE-INFLATED. ENGINEERING INVESTIGATION OF THE SCAN ABORT INDICATES THE CAUSE TO BE A HARDWARE ERROR. THE ERROR WAS FOUND TO OCCUR WHEN THE ANODE WAS RUNNING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE GE FIELD ENGINEER (FE) CORRECTED THE ISSUE BY REPLACING THE ANODE CABLE, HEMIT TANK, AND TUBE. NO RECURRENCE WAS OBSERVED SINCE THE PARTS WERE REPLACED. THE EVENT WAS FURTHER EVALUATED BY GE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS SPECIALISTS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS TYPE OF MALFUNCTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO LEAD TO A SERIOUS INJURY IN THE FUTURE. LUNG BIOPSIES HAVE KNOWN COMPLICATIONS THAT OCCUR ON A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EXAMINATIONS, ONE BEING PNEUMOTHRORAX; AND SEVERAL FACTORS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCEDURE THAT MY RESULT IN SUCH INJURY. IT IS UNKNOWN THAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THE SCAN ABORT DID NOT OCCUR. THUS, A HARDWARE ERROR SUCH AS THE ONE REPORTED COULD NOT BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO PNEUMOTHORAX. IT IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, THAT THE HCP CAN CEASE THE PROCEDURE AT ANY TIME BY WITHDRAWING THE NEEDLE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR FURTHER IMAGING BY THE CT SYSTEM."
1395126;1;REPORTED INDICATED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO INTERROGATE A PT'S GENERATOR DURING A REVISION SURGERY. THE HANDHELD DEVICE SCREEN WAS FROZEN. THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED SOFT AND HARD RESETS AND RE-INSERTED THE FLASHCARD, HOWEVER, THE ISSUE DID NOT RESOLVE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE HANDHELD DEVICE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.

1395206;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT A PATIENT ARRIVED AT AN OFFICE VISIT WITH DIFFERENT SETTINGS THAN SHE HAD PROGRAMMED. REVIEW OF THE FLASHCARD FROM THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD DEVICE REVEALED THE PATIENT'S SETTINGS WERE THE RESULT OF AN INTERRUPTED SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC TEST. THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT INTERROGATE THE PATIENT'S DEVICE AFTER PERFORMING DEVICE DIAGNOSTICS TO ENSURE THAT THE SETTINGS WERE CORRECT PRIOR TO THE PATIENT LEAVING THE OFFICE. THE PATIENT HAS BEEN REPROGRAMMED TO THE CORRECT SETTINGS. ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY.
1395651;0;"IT IS REPORTED THAT ONE OF THE SPIKES ON THE IM ALIGNMENT GUIDE BROKE OFF IN THE DISTAL FEMUR WHEN REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT. (B) (4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE MICRO-MILL ADJUSTABLE IM GUIDE WAS RETURNED AFTER ONE OF THE SPIKES BROKE OFF IN THE DISTAL FEMUR. THE DESIGN OF THE DEVICE INTENDS FOR IT TO BE IMPACTED ON THE HEAD; HOWEVER, DAMAGE MARKS THROUGHOUT THE PART INDICATE IT MAY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED OFF-AXIS, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE FROM THE PATIENT. IMPROPER USE APPEARS TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE COMPLAINT OR DEVICE FAILURE. AS RETURNED, THE INSTRUMENT EXHIBITS EVIDENCE OF EXTENSIVE USE AND/OR ABUSE. MUSHROOMING AND STRIKE MARKS ARE PRESENT WHERE THE SLAPHAMMER ENGAGED THE INSTRUMENT. THE TIGHTENING SCREW APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CROSS-THREADED INTO THE INSTRUMENT AND TIGHTENED/STRUCK WITH ANOTHER INSTRUMENT. ONE SPIKE HAS FRACTURED OFF AND THE ADJACENT SPIKE HAS A DEFORMED TIP WHICH INDICATES IT MAY HAVE BEEN STRUCK. NICKS AND GOUGES ARE PRESENT ALL ALONG THE SHAFT OF THE DEVICE.

1396142;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE SERIAL ADAPTER CABLE FOR THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD DEVICE. THE CABLE WAS BROKEN AND COULD NO LONGER BE USED. IT WAS UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER THE DAMAGE TO THE CABLE WAS DUE TO USAGE OVER TIME OR IF THERE WAS SOME DEFICIENCY WITH THE CABLE THAT CAUSED IT TO BREAK. A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE HANDHELD THAT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. THE HANDHELD DEVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED, HOWEVER, PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME.
1396271;1;IN MAY 2009, A SUPERDIMENSION FIELD TECHNICIAN WENT TO THE SITE TO CHECK THE SYSTEM AND REPORTED THAT TWO COMPONENTS OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, THE PT SENSOR TRIPLET (PST) AND THE UNION. AT THIS TIME, SUPERDIMENSION HAS NOT YET RECEIVED AND OR PROCESSED THE RETURN. USER ALLEGED SYSTEM WAS INACCURATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN COULD NOT REACH THE TARGET DURING NAVIGATION AND BELIEVED THIS WAS BECAUSE OF INACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM. THE PROCEDURE WAS NOT COMPLETED WITH SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, FLUOROSCOPY WAS USED AND THE CASE WAS COMPLETED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT.

1397261;1;"DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO A MANUFACTURING CONSULTANT DURING AN IMPLANT SURGERY THAT THEIR PROGRAMMING WAND WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATION WITH THE GENERATOR WHEN IT IS INSIDE THE PT'S GENERATOR POCKET. WHEN THE GENERATOR IS OUTSIDE THE POCKET EVERYTHING WORKED FINE, BUT AS SOON AS THEY PUT THE GENERATOR IN THE POCKET, THEY CANNOT ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION. ANOTHER PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS USED AND COMMUNICATION WAS SUCCESSFUL. THE PROGRAMMING WAND AND HANDHELD COMPUTER WERE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE HANDHELD MET SPECIFICATIONS. THE PROGRAMMING WAND POSITIVE BATTERY CABLE WAS LOOSE, WHICH CAUSED INTERMITTENT POWER TO THE DEVICE; THEREBY, CAUSING THE DEVICE TO FUNCTION INTERMITTENTLY. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIVE BATTERY SNAP CONNECTOR VERIFIED THAT IT WAS OUT OF SPECIFICATION (SPRUNG). AFTER POWER WAS PROPERLY SECURED FROM THE BATTERY CONNECTORS, THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS ELECTRICALLY TESTED AND WAS FOUND TO BE OPERATING WITHIN SPECIFICATION."
1397595;1;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THEY GAVE THE FIRST MEDICATION BEFORE SCHEDULE AND THEN ACKNOWLEDGED IT - ORDER HAS BEEN SCHEDULED A SECOND TIME BY SYSTEM, AND A SECOND DOSE OF MEDICATION WAS GIVEN. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT AFTER GIVING A FIRST DOSE MEDICATION BEFORE ITS SCHEDULED TIME AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE CHANGE, THE ORDER WAS SCHEDULED A SECOND TIME AND A SECOND DOSE OF MEDICATION WAS GIVEN. THE INITIAL EVALUATION OF THIS REPORT SUPPORTS THAT MEDICATION ORDERS ENTERED THROUGH THIS SOFTWARE, A PT COULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL UNINTENDED DOSE OF MEDICATION WITHIN A 24 HOUR PERIOD. THIS IS CAUSED BY A SOFTWARE DEFECT IN ICIP REV. D. IF THIS RECURS, IT COULD LEAD TO A MISTREATMENT OR LACK OF TREATMENT AND THEREFORE, COULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. PHILIPS IS IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS EVENT, AND THE COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SENT ONCE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED.

1398154;1;LAB RESULTS WERE REPORTED FOR THE WRONG PATIENT: A PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE ED WITH KIDNEY PAIN. THE PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT ASSIGNED TO THE PATIENT NOTED THAT TROPONIN LEVELS WERE REPORTED ON THIS PATIENT, BUT WERE NOT ORDERED. THE PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT NOTIFIED THE LAB IMMEDIATELY OF THE ERROR.  THE TROPONINS HAD ACTUALLY BEEN DRAWN FOR ANOTHER PATIENT ADMITTED TO THE ED ON THE SAME DAY FOR A CVA.  THERE WAS NO DELAY IN TREATMENT FOR THAT PATIENT.INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE LABORATORY RESULTS PRODUCED IN CERNER LABORATORY SOFTWARE SYSTEM WERE RESULTED CORRECTLY, AND THE SIEMENS HIS SOFTWARE SYSTEM ALSO RESULTED CORRECTLY.  HOWEVER, WHEN RESULTED OUT IN THE PICIS ED PULSECHECK (IBEX) SYSTEM, THE RESULTS WERE FOR THE WRONG PATIENT.LAB AND RADIOLOGY ORDERS ARE ENTERED THROUGH ED PULSECHECK, AND ARE SENT VIA OUR OPENLINK INTERFACE ENGINE OUT TO OUR SIEMENS HIS SYSTEM, WHERE AN ORDER NUMBER IS ASSIGNED AND COMMUNICATED BACK TO ED PULSECHECK VIA OPENLINK.  THE ORDER IS ALSO TRANSMITTED TO THE SIEMENS RADIOLOGY AND CERNER LAB ALONG WITH THE RESPECTIVE ORDER INFORMATION VIA OPENLINK.   ONCE THE ORDERS ARE RESULTED, SIEMENS RADIOLOGY AND CERNER LAB SEND RESULTS BACK VIA OPENLINK DIRECTLY INTO ED PULSECHECK AS WELL AS OUR HIS SYSTEM CONCURRENTLY.THE VENDOR HAS STATED THEY HAVE INFREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED THIS SAME ISSUE WITH OTHER CUSTOMER SITES. THIS CONFIRMS THAT THE INCORRECT POSTING OF RESULT TO THE WRONG PATIENT ACCOUNT WAS DUE TO ED PULSECHECK. THE INCORRECT POSTING SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED WHERE ED PULSECHECK DID NOT RECOGNIZE WHERE THE PREVIOUS LAB TRANSACTION TERMINATED AND TOOK THE ADT INFORMATION FROM THE NEXT RADIOLOGY RESULT THAT HIT THE INTERFACE AT THE SAME TIME, CAUSING THE INCORRECT POSTING.THE VENDOR, PICIS, HAS APPLIED A FIX TO INSURE THE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCURATELY BEING READ BY THE APPLICATION SO THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

1401250;0;IN 2008, THIS PT WAS IMPLANTED WITH GORE EXCLUDER AAA ENDOPROSTHESES TO TREAT AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM. A FOLLOW UP COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN TAKEN ON AN UNK DATE REVEALED THE ORIGINALLY IMPLANTED DEVICES PLACED TOO LOW FOR GOOD SEAL LONG TERM. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ENDOLEAK OR ANEURYSM GROWTH. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED TO REINTERVENE, DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE PHYSICIAN NOTICED THE ORIGINAL CONTRALATERAL LEG COMPONENT DID NOT HAVE 3CM OF OVERLAP, ONLY 1.5CM. IT WAS SUSPECTED THE DEVICE HAD MOVED POST-PROCEDURE DUE TO THE EXTREME NECK ANGULATION (80 DEGREES+) AND OVERALL ANGULATED ANATOMY. THE PHYSICIAN EXTENDED THE DEVICE USING A SECOND CONTRALATERAL LEG COMPONENT PROXIMALLY TO COVER THE OVERLAP. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE AND IS IN STABLE CONDITION. NO FURTHER INFO WAS AVAILABLE. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING PAPERWORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THE REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING PAPERWORK VERIFIED THAT HIS LOT MET ALL PRE-RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS.

1401251;0;"A MALE WITH TORTUOUS ANATOMY UNDERWENT INITIAL AAA REPAIR IN EARLY 2008. THE PT HAD A HIGH CREATININE LEVEL SO THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT WENT TO EXPOSE THE PT TO A LOT OF CT, SO HE PLACED ONE MAIN BODY, TWO ILIAC LEG GRAFTS, AND THEN PLACED A MAIN BODY EXTENSION ON THE RIGHT BECAUSE THE VESSEL WAS LARGER THAN THE 24MM. THIS WENT WELL AND THE PHYSICIAN PLACED A CARDIOMEM. ALL SHOWED FINE WITH NO ENDOLEAKS. IT IS UNK IF THE PT FOLLOWED UP PROPERLY. HE PRESENTED EMERGENTLY IN 2009, AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A LIMB SEPARATION ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THE REPAIR PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED TWO DAYS LATER. THE MAIN BODY EXTENSION HAD DISCONNECTED FROM THE RIGHT ILIAC LEG GRAFT. THE PHYSICIAN COIL EMBOLIZED THE HYPOGASTRIC, THEN PLACED A LONG FLEX LEG GRAFT UP TO THE GATE, AND THEN PLACED ANOTHER FLEX LEG TO EXTEND THE SEAL. THE PT IS FINE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZENITH DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ALL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION ACTIVITIES SHOWING THE DEVICE MEETS THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS MEET THE NEEDS OF THE USER. EACH DEVICE IS SHIPPED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) LISTING THE INDICATIONS FOR USE, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, AND THE CORRECT DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE. REGARDING THIS FAILURE MODE THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THE IFU ADDRESSES; THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM OVERLAP OF COMPONENTS ANATOMICAL CRITERIA. BALLOONING LOCATIONS. PT SIZING. PROPER PT FOLLOW-UP. BASED ON UNK FACTORS, THE PHYSICIAN DECIDED TO PLACE A MAIN BODY EXTENSION GRAFT DISTAL TO THE LEG EXTENSION BASED ON THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PT. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE NOTED, THE IFU FOR THE ANCILLARY DEVICES STATE THE ESBE (MAIN BODY EXTENSIONS) ARE TO BE USED FOR EXTENDING THE PROXIMAL BODY OF AN ENDOVASCULAR GRAFT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT THIS TIME TO SUGGEST THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE COMPONENT SEPARATION. A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE DISCONNECTION COULD BE UNFORESEEN ANATOMICAL FACTORS. AS NOTED ABOVE, THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE ANGLE OF 60 DEGREE BETWEEN THE SEPARATED COMPONENTS. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THE ANATOMY CHANGED OVER TIME TO THIS ANGLE SLOWLY CAUSING THE COMPONENTS TO SEPARATE. A SIMILAR SCENARIO COULD BE THE ANATOMY WAS IN THIS CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL PROCEDURE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED THE COMPONENTS TO SEPARATE OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH THE DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED THREE PIECES OF FILM WERE RETURNED FOR EXAMINATION. ALL PICTURES ARE FROM THE SECONDARY PROCEDURE ON 05/12/09.

A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). CATALOG#: FROM 7K62-31 TO 7K62-30. NO RETURNS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE CUSTOMER SITE AND NO TESTING WAS CARRIED OUT AS PART OF THIS COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION. FOR THIS INVESTIGATION A REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING AND TESTING DOCUMENTATION SHOWED THAT THE ARCHITECT TSH REAGENT LOT 72923JN00 PASSED ALL THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THREE PANELS ARE TESTED DURING FINAL PRODUCT RELEASE TESTING AND ALL SPECIFICATIONS WERE MET. NO EVENTS OR ISSUES WERE FOUND THAT COULD IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS REAGENT LOT. ALSO, AN ANALYSIS OF THE VARIATION IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF THIS LOT DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS PERFORMING WITHIN STATISTICAL CONTROL AND ALL GENERATED VALUES WERE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE UPPER AND LOWER SPECIFICATION LIMITS. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR ARCHITECT TSH REAGENT 7K62 AND IN PARTICULAR REAGENT LOT 72923JN00 DID NOT REVEAL ANY ADVERSE TREND FOR PERFORMANCE RELATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ASSAY. THE ARCHITECT TSH PACKAGE INSERT (B)(4) CONTAINS THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE CUSTOMER'S CONCERN ON THIS ISSUE. THE INVESTIGATION HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS NO DEFICIENCY RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ARCHITECT TSH REAGENT LOT 72923JN00, WHICH IS PERFORMING WITHIN LABEL CLAIMS. NO DEFICIENCY/MALFUNCTION RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE WAS IDENTIFIED. THIS IS A FINAL REPORT. THE CUSTOMER STATES THAT ONE PATIENT SAMPLE GENERATED AN ARCHITECT TSH ASSAY RESULT OF 0.19 UIU/ML. THIS SAME PATIENT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TESTED AT ANOTHER FACILITY AND GENERATED A TSH RESULT OF 30 UIU/ML (METHODOLOGY UNKNOWN). NO SUSPECT RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LAB. THERE IS NO IMPACT TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT REPORTED.
1416326;0;OTHER, (INTERVENTION REQUIRED) - EVALUATION RESULTS: (ENDOLEAK), (ANEURYSM ENLARGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ANGULATION. CONCLUSION: (ANEURYSM ENLARGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ANGULATION. AN ANEURX ABDOMINAL STENT GRAFT SYSTEM WAS IMPLANTED IN A PATIENT FOR THE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT OF A 5 CM ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM APPROXIMATELY 8 YEARS AGO. VESSEL MORPHOLOGY AT THE TIME OF IMPLANT WAS NOT REPORTED. ADDITIONAL AORTIC STENT GRAFT CUFFS WERE IMPLANTED APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS AGO FOR A MIGRATION DUE TO ENLARGEMENT OF THE ANEURYSM TO 6 CM AND SIGNIFICANT ANGULATION OF 45 DEGREES. AT A RECENT FOLLOW-UP, THE ANEURYSM WAS AGAIN NOTED TO HAVE ENLARGED AND THAT THE ANEURYSM AND AORTIC NECK WERE ANGULATED. THE ANGIOGRAM ALSO SHOWED CONTRAST IN THE ANEURYSM DUE TO A TYPE III ENDOLEAK, AS A STENT RING IN THE ANEURX ILIAC LIMB HAD SHIFTED, CAUSING SOME SUTURES TO BREAK AND CREATING A HOLE IN THE FABRIC. THE ENLARGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ANGULATION OF THE ANEURYSM HAD CAUSED THE LIMB STENT GRAFT TO SHIFT. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED TO RELINE THE LIMB WITH ANOTHER ANEURX LIMB, WITH SUCCESSFUL RESULTS. NO ADDITIONAL CLINICAL SEQUELAE WERE REPORTED, AND THE PATIENT IS FINE.
1416488;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER HAD A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGE. THE HANDHELD BATTERY WAS REPORTED TO BE NOT LASTING WHENEVER THE HANDHELD WAS UNPLUGGED FROM THE WALL. REPORTED SHE WOULD KEEP THE HANDHELD PLUGGED IN AT ALL TIMES AND THE POWER LIGHT WOULD NEVER TURN GREEN. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THUS FAR THE PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.
1416492;1;"REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S (B) (4) HANDHELD WAS FREEZING UPON INTERROGATION AND WAS BEING ""SLOW"". A MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVE PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. PRODUCT HAS BEEN REQUESTED, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER TO DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."
1416493;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD NOT EXPORT ANY DATA FROM THE FLASHCARD AND THERE WAS NO BATTERY CAPACITY LEFT. PRODUCT HAS BEEN REQUESTED, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER TO DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1416496;1;"REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE HANDHELD DEVICE WOULD FREEZE ON THE ""INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL"" SCREEN. RESET OF THE HANDHELD DEVICE WOULD RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER, THE SCREEN WOULD CONTINUE TO OCCASIONALLY FREEZE UPON USE AND THE PHYSICIAN REQUESTED A NEW HANDHELD. A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN AND HIS HANDHELD DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. THE SCREEN FREEZE WAS CONFIRMED AND IS DUE TO A COMPUTER SOFTWARE ERROR. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH EITHER THE RETURNED HANDHELD OR SOFTWARE."
1416625;1;CERNER DISTRIBUTED PRIORITY REVIEW FLASH NOTIFICATION (B)(4) ON (B)(4), 2008, TO ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED CLIENT SITES. THE FLASH INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE AND NOTIFIES CLIENTS OF THE SOFTWARE CORRECTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE (EXCEPTION PACKAGES (B)(4)). ADDITIONALLY, THE FLASH NOTIFIES CLIENTS THAT THEY CAN REMOVE FILTERS FROM TRACKING LISTS TO PREVENT THE ISSUE FROM OCCURRING UNTIL THE SOFTWARE CORRECTION CAN BE INSTALLED IN THEIR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. CERNER CORPORATION CONSIDERS THIS ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED AND NO FURTHER NARRATIVE IS REQUIRED FOR FOLLOW-UP. THE ISSUE INVOLVES CERNER MILLENNIUM FIRSTNET AND AFFECTS USERS THAT UTILIZE THE FILTER OPTION WITHIN THE TRACKING LIST TO LIMIT THE PATIENTS THAT ARE DISPLAYED IN THE LIST BASED ON SPECIFIC DISPLAY CRITERIA. IN CERNER MILLENNIUM FIRSTNET, WHEN THE USER SELECTS A PATIENT ON A FILTERED LIST AND THEN WAITS FOR THE SYSTEM TO AUTOMATICALLY REFRESH, A DIFFERENT PATIENT MAY ALSO BE HIGHLIGHTED AND A ROW INDICATOR DISPLAYED FOR THE NEW PATIENT IN ADDITION TO THE PATIENT, THE USER WAS ATTEMPTING TO SELECT. PATIENT CARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS CLINICIANS COULD INADVERTENTLY SELECT THE INCORRECT PATIENT AND PERFORM DOCUMENTATION ON THAT PATIENT RATHER THAN THE INTENDED PATIENT. THIS ISSUE COULD RESULT IN MEDICATION ORDERS AND CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCORRECT PATIENT.
1416630;1;"CONCLUSION - THE MEDICAL DEVICE PERFORMED AS INTENDED AND DID NOT MALFUNCTION. THE REPORTED INCIDENT OCCURRED SOLELY BECAUSE OF A UNIQUE SET OF SEQUENTIAL OPERATOR ERRORS. THIS SCENARIO IS UNIQUE BECAUSE THE OPERATOR ENTERED THE SAME ERRONEOUS SPECIMEN NUMBER ON TWO CRITICAL WINDOWS; ON THE RESULT ENTRY WINDOW, IF THE OPERATOR HAD ENTERED ANY SPECIMEN NUMBER OTHER THAN THE SAME ONE THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LINKED PREVIOUSLY, THE MEDICAL DEVICE WOULD HAVE DETECTED THE OPERATOR ERROR. WYNDGATE RECOMMENDS THAT THE SITE RETRAIN ITS EMPLOYEES ON THE PROPER USE OF WYNDGATE'S SOFTWARE. IT SHOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL OPERATOR CONTROLS ON ITS PROCESS LINKING THE SPECIMEN TO THE PATIENT. THE MEDICAL DEVICE IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATOR CONSISTENTLY AND ACCURATELY ENTERING CORRECT DATA FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THIS SYSTEM. THE SOFTWARE CAN ONLY REACT TO THE DATA THAT IS ENTERED. IN THIS CASE, WHERE THE WRONG DATA WAS ENTERED TWICE, HHB HAD NO WAY TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME. THE LINKAGE OF THE SPECIMEN TO THE PATIENT IS A CRITICAL ENTRY POINT WHICH FURTHER DEVICE PROCESSING OCCURS. A REMINDER WILL BE SENT TO ALL CLIENTS TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SPECIMEN LINKAGE AND DATA ENTRY. ACTION TAKEN - AS A PRECAUTION, WYNDGATE SENT A PRODUCT BULLETIN TO ALL OF ITS CLIENTS USING THE HBB SYSTEM REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SPECIMEN LINKAGE AND DATA ENTRY. THIS SAME NOTICE WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO THOROUGHLY TRAIN EMPLOYEES ON THE PROPER USE OF THE HBB SYSTEM. A CLIENT SITE REPORTED AN EVENT ON (B)(6) 2009 WHICH WAS CAUSED BY A SEQUENCE OF OPERATOR ERRORS. THE MEDICAL DEVICE WYNDGATE'S SAFETRACE TX REBRANDED AS HORIZON BLOOD BANK DID NOT MALFUNCTION. THE SCENARIO AT THE REPORTING SITE INVOLVED TWO PATIENTS (PATIENT A AND PATIENT B FOR DESCRIPTIVE REASONS) AND THEIR ASSOCIATED BLOOD SPECIMENS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SEQUENTIAL USER ERRORS IN ENTERING THE PATIENT'S SPECIMEN ACCESSION NUMBER, THE TESTING RESULTS FROM AN INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED SPECIMEN WERE LINKED TO THE WRONG PATIENT. INFORMATIONAL BULLETINS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED BY WYNDGATE TO ALL SITES THAT CURRENTLY USING EITHER HORIZON BLOOD BANK OR SAFETRACE TX PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURER NARRATIVE IS INCLUDED WITH THIS REPORT AS AN ATTACHMENT."
1417041;0;"DEVICE NOT RETURNED. ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURER NARRATIVE: THIS EVENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE REPORTABLE PER EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES PROCEDURES. THE INFORMATION WAS LEARNED THROUGH IMPLANT PATIENT REGISTRY. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW IS IN PROCESS. TWO REQUESTS WERE MADE (VIA E-MAIL) FOR THE DEVICE, OPERATIVE REPORT, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; HOWEVER, NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED AND NO DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED AFTER AN IMPLANT DURATION OF ZERO DAYS, DUE TO UNKNOWN REASONS. NO FURTHER DETAILS WERE PROVIDED. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS COMPLETED, AND THIS DEVICE PASSED ALL MANUFACTURING AND STERILIZATION INSPECTIONS WITH NO NONCONFORMANCE. NO CUSTOMER LETTER REQUIRED. THE PT HAD RIGHT COLON SURGERY (ANASTOMOSIS WAS PERFORMED WITH THE CAR 27 DEVICE). THE PT WAS RE-OPERATED DUE TO A LEAK."
1417838;0;"FINAL DEVICE ANALYSIS OF THE PUMP REVEALED NO ANOMALY FOUND; NORMAL DEVICE FUNCTION. THE CATHETER WAS NOT RETURNED. THE DEVICE SYSTEM WAS REMOVED DUE TO INFECTION. THE DEVICE SYSTEM WAS USED TO DELIVER BACLOFEN. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SENT IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE."
1417948;0;"THE LOT NUMBER IS NOT KNOWN; THEREFORE, THE DEVICE MANUFACTURE DATE AND EXPIRATION DATE CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT; THEREFORE, A FAILURE ANALYSIS IS NOT AVAILABLE. WE ARE NOT ABLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DEVICE AND THE CAUSE FOR THE EVENT. IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION RECEIVED A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE FILED. THE COMPLAINANT REPORTED THAT THE CLINICIANS IMPLANTED A SOLYX SINGLE INCISION SLING SYSTEM IN A FEMALE PATIENT IN 2009. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE A ""LITTLE [URINARY] RETENTION"" POST OPERATIVELY. THE PHYSICIAN SAW THE PATIENT SEVEN DAYS LATER, AND REPORTED THAT THE ISSUE HAD RESOLVED ON ITS OWN. THE PATIENT IS DOING ""GREAT""."
1417963;0;THE CAPSULAR BAG WAS DAMAGED DURING THE PHACO PROCEDURE. THE LENS WOULD NOT SIT PROPERLY THE INCISION WAS ENLARGED TO REMOVE THE LEN. THE LENS WAS REPLACED WITH AN ANTERIOR CHAMBER LENS.
1418516;1;ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. PER INVESTIGATION AT TIME OF EVENT: ISITE PACS VERSION 3.3 TAKES CONSISTENT APPROACH OF USING IMAGER PIXEL SPACING FOR MEASUREMENT PERFORMED ON PROJECTION RADIOGRAPHY IMAGES. IMAGER PIXEL SPACING IS REQUIRED TO BE PRESENT IN PROJECTION RADIOGRAPHY IMAGES. THIRD PARTY MODALITY IS USING AN OPTIMAL DICOM TAG WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE PRESENT IN A GIVEN IMAGE. THE OPTIONAL DICOM TAG IN USE BY THE THIRD PARTY MODALITY ESTIMATES CONVERSION FROM IMAGER PIXEL SPACING INTO THE PT PIXEL SPACING. THE VALUE OF ESTIMATED RADIOGRAPHIC MAGNIFICATION FACTOR DOES NOT NECESSARILY RELATE TO THE PLANE IN WHICH MEASUREMENT IS PERFORMED. THE VALUE OF ESTIMATED RADIOGRAPHIC MAGNIFICATION FACTOR MAY OR MAY NOT BE PRESENT, DEPENDENT ON MODALITY CONFIGURATION. THE ONLY ACCURATE WAY TO GET PT MEASUREMENTS ON PROJECTION IMAGING IS TO USE FIDUCIAL MARKERS AND CALIBRATE MEASUREMENTS. THIS CAPABILITY IS SUPPORTED IN ISITE PACS. THE 3.3 IFU INCLUDES WARNINGS OF MODALITY DEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS AND THE STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO USE FIDUCIAL MARKERS FOR DETERMINING MAGNIFICATION FACTORS. NO REPORT OF PT HARM OR INJURY RELATED TO THIS EVENT. CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT MEASUREMENT IS INCONSISTENT WITH MEASUREMENT PERFORMED ON MODALITY.
1418570;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. THE COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PRODUCT ANALYSIS. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1418625;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT WHILE USING A WAND TO PROGRAM, THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL RECEIVED A CHECK SUM ERROR MESSAGE INDICATING THERE WERE COMMUNICATION ISSUES. THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL USED ANOTHER HANDHELD AND THE SAME WAND, BUT THE ERROR PREVAILED. USING ANOTHER WAND AND THE SAME HANDHELD PROVED TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY. ADDITIONAL INFO PROVIDED BY THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL REVEALED THAT THE CORD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WAND WAS LOOSE. PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER AND IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING PRODUCT ANALYSIS.

1418693;0;A CUSTOMER IN (B)(6) REPORTED VIA THEIR DISTRIBUTOR THAT ONE OF THE ELBOW TABS HAD BROKEN OFF AN HC407 NASAL MASK DURING THE NIGHT. THE TAB WENT INTO THE PT'S NOSE AND THEN HE COUGHED IT OUT. WE HAVE BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PT, AND HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT HE SUFFERED NO ILL EFFECTS FROM THIS INCIDENT. WE WERE ABLE TO FURNISH HIM WITH A FREE REPLACEMENT MASK, WHICH IS ONE OF OUR NEWER MODELS AND HAS NO TABS. (B)(4). THE DEVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION, HOWEVER, WE ARE AWARE OF THIS SITUATION FROM PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS AND THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE INFO PROVIDED. PLASTIC LOCKING TABS INCORPORATED INTO THE ELBOW CONNECTOR OF THESE CPAP MASKS MAY BREAK OFF IF THEY ARE NOT CLEANED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A RETAIL LEVEL RECALL ON ALL TAB DESIGNED CONNECTOR FOR CPAP MASKS. THE US RECALL WAS INITIATED ON 29 NOV 2006, UNDER RECALL NUMBER Z-0969-74-2007. ALL PRODUCT MANUFACTURED SINCE APR 2006 FEATURES A REDESIGNED CONNECTOR THAT REMOVES THE LOCKING TABS AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS RECALL.
1418774;0;IT IS REPORTED THAT DURING SURGERY IN 2009, THE SURGEON COULD NOT GET THE BACKSIDE OF THE ARTICULAR SURFACE LOCKED INTO THE TIBIAL TRAY. SURGERY WAS DELAYED 30 MINUTES. EVALUATION SUMMERY: EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE CONCLUDED THAT ONE OR BOTH SIDES OF THE INNER DOVETAIL LIPS ARE COMPRESSED DOWN INDICATING THAT IT DID NOT SLIDE UNDER THE MALE DOVETAIL ON THE TIBIA PLATE, INSTEAD WENT OVER. THIS MAY RESULT WHEN ARTICULAR SURFACE IS NOT CORRECTLY PLACED AND ORIENTED BEFORE PUSHING IT USING THE INSERTER INSTRUMENT. INCORRECT INSERTION TECHNIQUE APPEARS TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. EVALUATION: DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS INDICATE ALL COMPONENTS WERE MANUFACTURED AND INSPECTED TO SPECIFICATION.
1418905;0;A GE REPRESENTATIVE EVALUATED THE SYSTEM AND REPLACED A BLOWN FUSE, AND REPAIRED THE J1 CONNECTOR. SYSTEM OPERATES AS INTENDED. CUSTOMER REPORTED THE SYSTEM IS DISPLAYING AN INTERLOCK FAILURE MESSAGE. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED.
1419194;1;DELAY IN TREATMENT RELATED TO EQUIPMENT FAILURE ON 4 PATIENTS. THE IMAGES WERE FROZEN ON THE LIST AND WOULD NOT TRANSMIT ON THE FUJI READER EQUIPMENT. THE SYSTEM WAS REBOOTED WITHOUT CHANGE. A FEW HOURS LATER THE SYSTEM WAS AGAIN SHUT DOWN AND REBOOTED AND THE IMAGES THEN DID TRANSFER. IMAGES WERE REPEATED ON EQUIPMENT IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. THE NEXT DAY THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRED WITH 4 MORE PATIENTS AND THE SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN TO AWAIT EVALUATION BY THE MANUFACTURER.  THIS PROBLEM WAS TRACED TO A COMPUTER VIRUS (CONFICKER) WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE AFFECTING 6 FUJI CR UNITS.   THE HOSPITAL'S IMAGING SERVICE ENGINEER APPLIED A MICROSOFT PATCH (MS08-067) TO THE 6 FUJI UNITS TO PREVENT THE VIRUS FROM RE-INFECTING THE SYSTEMS.SUBSEQUENT TO THIS PROBLEM ONE OF THE FUJI UNITS EXPERIENCED A SHUTDOWN, WHICH WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACEMENT OF A DEFECTIVE POWER SUPPLY.  THIS FAILURE IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE RELATED TO THE VIRUS ISSUE.
1419529;1;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT WHILE ENTERING AND CHECKING MEDICAL ORDER ENTRY, PRESCRIPTION SCREEN DIDN'T REPORT COMPLETE PRESCRIPTION AND DIDN'T REPORT KC1 IONS (POTASSIUM) NEEDED FOR PT TREATMENT. PHILIPS IS IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS EVENT AND THE COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED ONCE THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED.
1419795;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS WORKING INTERMITTENTLY. THE COMPUTER WAS FULLY CHARGED AND WAS USED ON BATTERY POWER ONLY, BUT COMMUNICATION ERRORS WOULD OCCUR. THE PROGRAMMING WAND USED WITH THE COMPUTER PERFORMED AS INTENDED WITH ANOTHER VNS COMPUTER, RULING OUT THE WAND. A LOOSE COMPUTER SERIAL CABLE WAS SUSPECTED. THE COMPUTER, A/C ADAPTER, AND FLASHCARD WERE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, BUT THE SERIAL CABLE WAS NOT RETURNED. ANALYSIS OF THE COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD REVEALED NO ANOMALIES AND THE COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD PERFORMED PER SPECIFICATIONS. THE SERIAL CABLE HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR RETURN BUT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED IN THE SERIAL CABLE WHICH WAS NOT RETURNED.
1419972;0;WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF EVENT IS MOST LIKELY TECHNIQUE RELATED, EXTENSIVE LAB TESTING HAS SHOWN THAT UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS THE REPORTED EVENT MODE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED, HOWEVER, UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS, THAT IS WHEN THE DRILL GUIDE WAS BENT DURING DRILLING WITH A DRILL BIT, THIS CAUSED THE DRILL BIT TO RUB AGAINST INNER SURFACE OF THE BENT DRILL GUIDE CAUSING SOME METAL TO SHAVE OFF OF THE DRILL GUIDE, THE REPORTED CONDITION WAS THEN DUPLICATED. THERE HAS BEEN SOME MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CHANGES MADE TO SUBVERT AND OR GREATLY REDUCE THIS TYPE OF EVENT. THE PHENOMENA IS STILL UNDER STUDY BY THE MITEK QAE GROUP AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE RELATIVE FAILURE MODE DEVICES WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE GROUP TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR STUDY, ALSO, MITEK WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK ANY RELATED COMPLAINTS WITHIN THIS DEVICE FAMILY AS A MEANS OF MONITORING THE EXTENT WITH WHICH THIS COMPLAINT IS OBSERVED IN THE FIELD. WHEN AND IF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE(S) IS RECEIVED HERE AT DEPUTY MITEK, IT WILL BE SUBJECTED TO A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS. IF THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES ANY OTHER DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED. OUR REP IS REPORTING THAT DURING AN ARTHROSCOPIC SHOULDER REPAIR, METAL SHAVINGS WERE OBSERVED EMANATING FROM A LUPINE DRILL GUIDE AND FALLING INTO THE PT'S JOINT SPACE. ALL OF THE DEBRIS WAS REMOVED FROM THE BODY AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUE OR HARM TO THE PT. COMPLAINT DEVICES DISCARDED BY USER FACILITY. THE REP STATES THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH 4 DRILL GUIDES AT 2 CASES EACH, NO DATES GIVEN. SEE ALSO MDRS 1221934-2009-00146, 1221934-2009-00147, 1221934-2009-00148, 1221934-2009-00149, 1221934-2009-00150, 1221934-2009-00151 AND 1221934-2009-00152.
1419991;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR DELL X5 HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINING 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE FROZE AFTER INTERROGATION. THE 7.1 FLASHCARD WAS REINSERTED INTO THE HANDHELD COMPUTER, AND DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. MANUFACTURER IS PENDING THE PRODUCT TO BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.
1420032;1;"REPORTER INDICATED A VNS THERAPY HANDHELD PROGRAMMING COMPUTER WAS HAVING PROBLEMS COMPLETING INTERROGATIONS ON TWO SEPARATE PTS. THE DATA RECEIVED LIGHT ON THE WAND IS ON AND THE SCREEN ONE HE HANDHELD COMPLETES THE INTERROGATION, HOWEVER, AN SQL MESSAGE IS RECEIVED. A HARD RESET DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE PHYSICIAN ONLY HAS THE ONE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD; THEREFORE, ACCIDENTALLY INSERTION OF A DIFFERENT FLASHCARD IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT TO DATE. THE HANDHELD HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND PENDING ANALYSIS."
1420038;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD DEVICE COULD NOT BE USED, BECAUSE AN ERROR MESSAGE WOULD BE OBTAINED THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE USER TO PROCEED FURTHER. THE HANDHELD WAS RECEIVED BY THE MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS WITH THE MAIN BATTERY DEPLETED. AS A RESULT, THE V6.1.7 SOFTWARE WAS NO LONGER INSTALLED IN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND THE REPORTED COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED. AN ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED FLASHCARD WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY ANOMALIES THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. DURING THE ANALYSIS, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE FLASHCARD CONTAINED TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DATABASES. THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR IDENTIFIED ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLASHCARD BEING INSERTED INTO THE HANDHELD AFTER IT HAD BEEN UPGRADED TO V7.1. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED.

THE HANDHELD COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PRODUCT ANALYSIS. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1420564;0;CONCLUSION: NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. SHOULD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BE OBTAINED, A SUPPLEMENTAL FORM WILL BE SUBMITTED ACCORDINGLY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PATIENT UNDERWENT A LAPAROSCOPIC IMPLANT OF HERNIA REPAIR MESH ON AN UNKNOWN DATE. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A RE-OPERATION ON AN UNKNOWN DATE DUE TO AN ABDOMINAL BULGE AND PAIN. ADHESIONS WITH BOTH BOWEL AND OMENTUM HAD DEVELOPED AGAINST THE MESH. THE ADHESIONS WERE ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AREAS OF THE MESH AND NOT TO ANY OTHER AREA OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL. THE ADHESIONS WERE AGAINST THE MESH POLYPROPYLENE MATERIAL AND NOT THE TACKS. ADDITIONAL OPERATION WAS DUE TO THE ADHESIONS AND A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PERMANENT MESH WAS IMPLANTED.
1420690;0;"RETAIN SAMPLES FROM TEST STRIPS LOT 0822524 HAVE BEEN TESTED AND ONE OF EIGHT RETAIN VIALS WAS CONFIRMED TO ALSO PRODUCE LOW RESULTS WITH CONTROL SOLUTION TESTING. FURTHER OBSERVATION OBSERVED A SCRATCH IN THE CHANNEL OF THE CARBON SIDE OF THE STRIP. THE SCRATCH COMPLETELY SEVERS THE CHANNEL CAUSING AN ELECTRICAL ""OPEN"". THE LOCATION OF THE SCRATCH LEAVES HALF OF THE CARBON AREA TO CONDUCT CHANGE DURING THE REACTION, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A LOW READINGS. THESE ERRONEOUS RESULTS MAY OCCUR IN THE ""C"" ZONE OF THE PARKES ERROR GRID, AND AS SUCH, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. REMEDIAL ACTION WAS REPORTED TO THE DISTRICT OFFICE IN 2009. CUSTOMER REPORTED RECEIVING READINGS OF 118 MG/DL AND 85 MG/DL, WHICH WERE LOWER THAN THEY FELT. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH, SERIOUS INJURY OR MISTREATMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT."
1420908;0;"IT IS INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF THE BATCH HISTORY, HISTORICAL TRENDING, AND SIMILAR COMPLAINT TRENDING REVIEW FOR THE PRODUCT FAMILY WILL BE CONDUCTED. IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. SAME CASE AS MFG. # 2134265-2009-03497. IT WAS REPORTED IN A REPORT OF THE 18TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE FOREIGN SOCIETY OF INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY (CVIT), THAT DURING A PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONAL (PCI) PROCEDURE, A GUIDE WIRE FRACTURE AND VESSEL PERFORATION OCCURRED. THE LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY. ROTATIONAL ATHERECTOMY WAS PERFORMED WITH A ROTALINK 1.25MM BURR. A FLOPPY RTW GUIDE WIRE WAS FRACTURED IN THE LAD. THE DISTAL TIP OF THE FLOPPY RTW WAS PLACED DEEP INTO A SMALL BRANCH OF THE DISTAL LAD, AND IT WAS FELT THAT THE FRACTURE WAS CAUSED BY ENTRAPMENT OF THE WIRE TIP IN THE TINY ARTERY. THE WIRE WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE RETRIEVED. TWO GUIDE WIRES FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER WERE ADVANCED INTO THE DISTAL LAD AND TWISTED TOGETHER TO ENTRAP THE RETAINED WIRE, UNSUCCESSFULLY. THREE ADDITIONAL WIRES FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS WERE USED TO SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURE THE WIRE. ANGIOGRAM REVEALED A MINOR PERFORATION OF THE LAD, WHICH WAS TREATED WITH AN UNSPECIFIED PROLONGED BALLOON INFLATION. THE PATIENT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL, AND WAS RELEASED 2 DAYS LATER. FURTHER INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE."
1421304;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE HANDHELD COMPUTER HAD A SCREEN FREEZE AT THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. TROUBLESHOOTING RESOLVED THE EVENT WITH A COMPUTER HARD RESET.

THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A NEW PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AND WAS REQUESTED TO SEND BACK THE OLD PROGRAMMING SYSTEM TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS, HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1421699;1;ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. CUSTOMER IS A MULTIPLE ORGANIZATION (MULTI-ORG) CONFIGURATION USING ONE ARCHIVE. THEIR DICTATION SYSTEM QUERIES THE ARCHIVE FOR EXAMS BASED ONLY ON EXAM ACCESSION (ACC) NUMBER. ACC NUMBERS ARE UNIQUE WITHIN A GIVEN ORGANIZATION FOR A GIVEN EXAM, BUT THE SAME ACC NUMBER MAY BE USED IN ANOTHER ORGANIZATION. IF THE USER QUERIES BY ACC NUMBER FROM WITHIN THE ISITE PACS APPLICATION, ISITE PACS ALSO PROVIDES AND ORG ID TO THE ARCHIVE, SO THAT THE CORRECT EXAM IS RETURNED. IN THIS CASE, THE SITE WAS QUERYING FROM WITHIN THEIR DICTATION SYSTEM FOR AN EXAM USING ONLY THE ACC NUMBER. IF MULTIPLE EXAMS EXIST WITH THE ACC NUMBER, THE DICTATION SYSTEM IS OPENING THE FIRST EXAM RETURNED. WORK AROUND PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER, INSTRUCTED TO QUERY FOR EXAMS FROM WITHIN ISITE PACS APPLICATION. HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT INDICATED THIS IS HIGHLY DETECTABLE: RETURNED EXAM IS OF DIFFERENT TYPE THAN THE REPORT/DICTATION WORKLIST INDICATES, I.E. REPORT REFERENCES US, BUT RETURNED EXAM IS CT. REPORT/WORKLIST AND RETURNED EXAM SHOW OBVIOUS MISMATCH. PT DEMOGRAPHIC INFO IN THE REPORT/WORKLIST AND THE EXAM DO NOT MATCH. DICTATION SYSTEM QUERY BEING CHANGED TO INCLUDE MRN AND ACC#. NO REPORT OF PT HARM OR INJURY RELATED TO THIS EVENT. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AN UPGRADE, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT WHEN USING THIRD PARTY DICTATION WORKLIST TO QUERY FOR IMAGES IN ISITE PACS, INCORRECT IMAGES SOMETIMES RETURNED.
1421706;1;NO REPORT OF PT HARM OR INJURY RELATED TO THIS EVENT. CUSTOMER REPORTED SCOUTLINES NOT MATCHING. ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. CUSTOMER IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE WHILE USING ISITE PACS TO VIEW THE IMAGES AND MPRS FROM THE MODALITY. THIRD PARTY MODALITY ISSUE. FOR MULTI-PLANAR REFORMATIONS (MPR) AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY THIRD PARTY MODALITY AFTER ACQUIRING IMAGES WITH A GANTRY TILT, THE SCOUTLINES ON THE REFORMATIONS DO NOT ALIGN CORRECTLY TO ORIGINAL AXIAL SERIES AND SCOUT. IF CUSTOMER MANUALLY GENERATES AN MPR FROM THE MODALITY, SCOUTLINES ARE WORKING CORRECTLY. CUSTOMER INSTRUCTED TO ESCALATE TO THEIR MODALITY VENDOR.
1421714;1;CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT A PT HAD A STUDY PERFORMED AND BECAUSE THE IMAGES WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE IN ISITE PACS, THE REFERRING PHYSICIANS USED THIRD PARTY PACS (RUNNING IN PARALLEL TO ISITE PACS) TO REVIEW THE IMAGES, AFTER WHICH THEY SENT THE PT HOME. ONCE THE STUDY WAS AVAILABLE IN ISITE PACS, RADIOLOGISTS IDENTIFIED ALLEGED CRITICAL FINDING AND HAD TO CALL THE PT BACK TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER PREVIOUSLY BEING SENT THEM HOME. ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT A PT HAD TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE HOSPITAL, BUT HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY ADDITIONAL PT INFO OR DETAILS AS TO ALLEGED CRITICAL FINDING OR PT IMPACT DUE TO FINDING. PT OUTCOME SHOULD NOT DIFFER DUE TO DISPLAY OF IMAGES IN DIFFERENT PACS DEVICES. UNKNOWN WHY HOSPITAL WOULD DISCHARGE WITHOUT CONFIRMATION FROM RADIOLOGY.
1421871;0;CUSTOMER REPORTED BLOOD GLUCOSE RESULTS OF 338 MG/DL AND 165 MG/DL WITHIN 10 MINS ON THE AVIVA SYSTEM. CUSTOMER REPORTED NO SYMPTOMS, DID NOT TREAT OR ACT ON RESULTS. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR THE RETURN OF THE SYSTEM, REPLACEMENT WAS SENT.
1421934;1;DEVICE EVAL: SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE EVAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM WAS ISOLATED TO ONE BRANCH OF LOGIC IN THE SOURCE CODE IN A SINGLE PROGRAM UNIT. THE PROBLEM IS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM NOT USING THE CORRECT DATES TO DECIDE WHETHER A PRODUCT QUALIFIES FOR THE LATE PRODUCTION PROHIBITING FACTOR, I.E., THOSE PRODUCTS THAT MUST BE MANUFACTURED WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF HOURS OR DAYS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD PASS TWO DATES TO THE CONTROL LOGIC BUT THE SYSTEM WAS PASSING ONLY ONE DATE. A CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE LOGIC TO CORRECTLY PASS DATES TO THE COMPONENT LATE PRODUCTION PROCESS DURING THE UPLOAD DONOR LINK PROCESS. ALL OTHER POSSIBLE BRANCHES OF THE LOGIC WERE REVIEWED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PASSING THE CORRECT DATES. RISK ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION WAS VERIFIED AND VALIDATED. THE SCOPE OF THE TESTING INCLUDED THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION ITSELF, ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED AREAS OF THE SOFTWARE, AND OTHER REGRESSION TESTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FIX WAS EFFECTIVE AND DID NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SOFTWARE. THE TESTED SOFTWARE MODIFICATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS THE WEEK OF MARCH 23, 2009. UNDER SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT HAVE STRINGENT MFG TIME LIMITS, IF A COMPONENT WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF SPECIFIED TIME LIMITS, THE SYSTEM MAY NOT PREVENT IT FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED. THIS PROBLEM CAN OCCUR IF BLOOD DONATION INFO FROM A MOBILE COLLECTION IS UPLOADED TO THE SOFTWARE AFTER THE COMPONENT HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED IN THE SYSTEM. IF THE BLOOD DONATION INFO HAS BEEN INPUT INTO THE SYSTEM BEFORE THE COMPONENT IS CREATED IN THE SYSTEM, THEN THE SOFTWARE WILL FLAG THE COMPONENT AS LATE PRODUCTION AND PREVENT IT FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED. AS A WORKAROUND, THE USER FACILITIES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ENTER DONATION INFO FROM MOBILE COLLECTIONS USING DIFFERENT REGISTRATION SCREEN(S) OF THE SOFTWARE. A SAFETY ADVISORY, WHICH INCLUDED THE WORKAROUND, WAS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS. IN ADDITION, AN URGENT SOFTWARE FIX HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE.

1422470;0;ECMO WAS ACTIVATED FOR A PATIENT WHO HAD A CARDIAC ARREST AND WAS RECEIVING CPR. WHILE THE ECMO CIRCUIT WAS BEING SET UP, THE ECMO CIRCUIT WAS PLACED INTO THE ROLLER HEAD OF THE PUMP INCORRECTLY. THE CIRCUIT WAS PLACE IN THE PUMP RACEWAY BACKWARDS WHICH CAUSED THE CIRCUIT TO FILL WITH AIR. THE CIRCUIT WAS CLAMPED, THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND THE CIRCUIT WAS DE-AIRED. ESTIMATED LENGTH OF TIME FROM UNTIL ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED WAS ABOUT 5-6 MINUTES. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED PRIOR TO BEING USED ON THE PATIENT. THE USER WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DEVICE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS OCCUR PREVIOUSLY AT OUR FACILITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY TAKING STEPS TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE SUCH AS LABELING THE TUBING, AND THE PUMP WITH DIRECTIONAL ARROWS AS WELL AS DOING A TIME OUT TO CHECK THE TUBING FOR PROPER PLACEMENT. WE SUGGEST THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER MANUFACTURE DESIGN SUCH AS COLOR CODING THE LINES WITH RED FOR ARTERIAL AND BLUE FOR VENOUS. ADDITIONALLY, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO GUIDE THE USER IN THE CORRECT CIRCUIT PLACEMENT. THE TUBING DOES NOT CURRENTLY COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOADING THE PUMP.

1425021;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD WAS SHOWING MULTIPLE DATES. THE PHYSICIAN CALLED THE MANUFACTURER FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. THE PHYSICIAN THEN PERFORMED MAGNET MODE DIAGNOSTICS AND RE-INTERROGATED THE PATIENT, BUT THE ISSUED PREVAILED. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE PHYSICIAN INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR WAS FINE AND THAT IT WAS RELATED TO ROLL-OVER OF TOTAL TIME AND MAGNET ACTIVATIONS WHICH SHOULD RESOLVE ONCE THE PATIENT HAS HAD FIFTEEN MAGNET ACTIVATIONS. THE PHYSICIAN ACKNOWLEDGED AND THE STATED THAT HE WOULD RE-INTERROGATE THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR AT THE NEXT VISIT. INFORMATION RECEIVED BY A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE REVEALED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SEEN BY THE PHYSICIAN FOR AN EEG AND THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT RE-INTERROGATE THE DEVICE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1425026;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER'S SCREEN WAS FREEZING CONTINUOUSLY. IT FROZE DURING INTERROGATION AND SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS, AS WELL AS AT THE MAIN MENU. THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED WITH THE REMOVAL AND REINSERTION OF THE FLASHCARD WITH SOFTWARE. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. THE CAUSE FOR THE SCREEN FREEZE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.
1425165;0;THE SUBJECT DEVICE IS NOT CLEARED FOR SALE IN THE U.S., BUT A SIMILAR DEVICE IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. AND WAS CLEARED. AN EVALUATION OF THE DEVICE CANNOT BE PERFORMED, AS THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, IT WILL BE SUBMITTED IN A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.

1426128;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS HOSPITALIZED DUE TO HYPERGLYCEMIA. THE REPORTED BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS 524 MG/DL. THE CUSTOMER DECLINED TO PERFORM TROUBLESHOOTING. THE CUSTOMER STATED THE CANNULA OF THE INFUSION SET WAS BENT, WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE EVENT. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. WE, THEREFORE, CONSIDER THIS REPORT COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE.
1426601;1;PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THEIR PROGRAMMING WAND WAS NOT ABLE TO INTERROGATE PT'S GENERATORS. ANOTHER WAND WAS USED WITH THE SAME HANDHELD COMPUTER AND WAS ABLE TO INTERROGATE CORRECTLY. A COMPANY REP RAN NORMAL TROUBLESHOOTING, BUT THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS, WHICH CONFIRMED THE ISSUE WITH THE PROGRAMMING WAND. THEY FOUND THAT THE SERIAL DATA CABLE HAD INTERMITTENT CONDUCTORS WHICH PRODUCE COMMUNICATION ERRORS. AFTER A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE WAS USED, THE COMMUNICATION ERRORS RESOLVED, AND THE WAND PASSED ALL OTHER ELECTRICAL AND FUNCTIONAL TESTS. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1426604;1;"IT WAS REPORTED TO THE MANUFACTURER THAT SITE'S HANDHELD SCREEN WAS CONTINUALLY FREEZING FOLLOWING INTERROGATIONS. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD WOULD TEMPORARILY RESOLVE THE FREEZING SCREEN; HOWEVER, THE SITE REQUESTED THAT A NEW DEVICE BE SENT TO REPLACE THE NON-WORKING DEVICE. THE NON-WORKING DEVICE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD AND FLASHCARD. THE HANDHELD WAS FOUND TO BE OPERATING WITHIN DESIGNED LIMITS AND THERE WERE NO PERFORMANCE OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF ADVERSE CONDITIONS FOUND. NO ANOMALIES WITH THE HANDHELD WERE IDENTIFIED THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THE EVENT WAS DUPLICATED IN THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS LABORATORY WITH THE SOFTWARE WHILE OPERATING IN THE HANDHELD. IT IS A KNOWN EVENT TO OCCUR WITH THE PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE VERSION 7.1."
1426788;0;BIPOLAR IMPEDANCES WERE LOW FOR ONE LEAD. THE HCP PROGRAMMED TO BE USED IN UNIPOLAR MODE. THE IMPEDANCE WAS 350 OHMS. THE HCP WAS AWARE THIS MAY DECREASE THE LONGEVITY OF THE DEVICE. FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING WAS POSTPONED UNTIL DEEP BRAIN STIMULATOR REPLACEMENT. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY.
1426997;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS THERAPY HANDHELD PROGRAMMING COMPUTER SCREEN FREEZES UPON INTERROGATION. FLASHCARD RE-INSERTION CORRECTED THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON THE HANDHELD AND ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE AND NO ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED. HOWEVER, IT IS KNOWN THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THIS TYPE OF SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTERS.
1426998;1;IT WAS REPORTED A VNS THERAPY HANDHELD PROGRAMMING COMPUTER WOULD NOT TURN ON. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND AN ANALYSIS VERIFIED THE EVENT. THE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED ALLEGATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEFECTIVE SERIAL CABLE THAT PREVENTED THE MAIN BATTERY FROM CHARGING. NO FURTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.
1427091;1;DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD WOULD NOT HOLD CHARGE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCT FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1427289;0;EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE NOMINAL FIT OF THE IMPLANT TO THE BONE PREPARATION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN INTERFERENCE FIT CONDITION TO PROVIDE MECHANICAL STABILITY IN THE ABSENCE OF BONE CEMENT. DEPENDING ON PATIENT BONE QUALITY AND THE AMOUNT OF BONE REMOVED, THE REMAINING BONE MAY NOT ALLOW THE IMPLANT TO SEAT WITH NORMAL IMPACT FORCES IN SOME CASES. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION A DEFINITIVE CAUSE CAN NOT BE DETERMINED. EVALUATION: DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS INDICATE ALL COMPONENTS WERE MANUFACTURED AND INSPECTED TO SPECIFICATION. IT IS REPORTED THAT DURING SURGERY IN 2009, THE SURGEON FIT THE HUMERUS FOR THE TRIAL COMPONENT WHICH SEATED PERFECTLY. UPON INSERTING THE IMPLANT IT SAT PROUD AND ONLY SEATED HALF WAY.
1427378;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S PROGRAMMING WAND WOULD NOT ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH MULTIPLE GENERATORS. THE WAND BATTERY WAS REPLACED, HOWEVER, THE ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED. THE WAND WAS TRIED WITH MULTIPLE HANDHELD DEVICES AND WOULD STILL NOT WORK. THE HANDHELD'S WERE VERIFIED TO BE WORKING PROPERLY WITH ANOTHER WAND. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT WAND AND THE OLD WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. DURING DEVICE EVALUATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE WAND'S SERIAL DATA CABLE HAD INTERMITTENT CONDUCTORS WHICH PRODUCED THE COMMUNICATION ERRORS. ONCE THE CABLE WAS REPLACED WITH A KNOWN GOOD CABLE, ALL COMMUNICATION ERRORS CLEARED AND FULL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE WAND WAS RESTORED. NO VISUAL ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED AND THE BATTERY CABLE PASSED CONTINUITY TESTING. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1427928;1;WHEN MULTIPLE USERS SIMULTANEOUSLY ARE ADDING PATIENT AND REQUEST, IT IS FOUND THAT SOME PATIENTS ARE GETTING THE WRONG REQUESTS ATTACHED. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE AS THIS IS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE UPDATED THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD AND THE UPDATE HAD RESULTED IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT MEETS THE REPORTABILITY CRITERIA AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD FOR GE HEALTHCARE. CODE FIX RELEASED IN PATCH INSTALLED 28-JUN-2007.
1427930;1;THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE AS THIS IS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE UPDATED THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD AND THE UPDATE HAD RESULTED IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT MEETS THE REPORTABILITY CRITERIA AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD FOR GE HEALTHCARE. INVESTIGATION DETERMINED AFTER TRAIL FILE REVIEW ONE SPECIMEN HAD A WRONG PATIENT ASSOCIATED, THE OTHER SPECIMEN HAD THE CORRECT PATIENT. ALSO, THE TRACE FILES SHOWED THAT THE PATIENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST SPECIMEN DID NOT EXIST IN THE DATABASE, IT WAS ADDED LATER, WHEN THE CORRECTION WAS MADE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE USER SELECTED THE WRONG PATIENT IN THE BEGINNING, WENT BACK IN TO CORRECT LATER, SEARCHED FOR THE RIGHT PATIENT, DID NOT FIND THE PATIENT IN THE DATABASE, ADDED THE PATIENT AND CORRECTED THE PATIENT INFO ON SPECIMEN. PROBLEM WAS NOT REPRODUCIBLE. (B) (4). PATIENT INFORMATION FOR TWO PATIENTS THAT WERE ACCESSIONED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY HAVE NAME AND DETAILS THAT ARE INCORRECT. PATIENT INFORMATION IN MASTHEAD.DAT IS CORRECT, BUT THE INFORMATION IN THE PATIENT'S FILE IS INCORRECT. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.
1427935;1;THE VALUES (PT VALUE AND D-DIMER VALUE) ARE NOT CONSISTENT IN VIEWER AND REPORT. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE AS THIS IS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE UPDATED THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD AND THE UPDATE HAS RESULTED IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT MEETS THE REPORTABILITY CRITERIA AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD FOR GE HEALTHCARE. INVESTIGATION REVEALED, WHEN VIEWING RESULTS IN PATIENT VIEWER AND A COAGULATION RESULT IS OUTSIDE OF A LINEARITY LIMIT (HIGH OR LOW) THEN ALL OF THE RESULTS PROCESSED AFTER THIS WILL SHOW THE SAME RESULT AS THE RESULT WITH THE OUT OF LINEARITY LIMIT. THIS IS DUE TO THE LINEARITY LIMIT WILL OVERRIDE THE ACTUAL RESULT. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS NOT RESETTING THE VARIABLE THAT CHECKS THIS, ONCE THE PROGRAM HAS FOUND THE OVER/UNDER LINEARITY LIMIT FLAG IT DOES NOT RESET AND PLACES THAT VALUE INTO THE RESULT FIELDS FOR THE REMAINING RESULTS THAT FOLLOW. IF THE ACTUAL RESULT IS OUTSIDE THE LIMIT THEN IT WILL FLAG, IF IT IS NOT OUTSIDE THE LIMIT, IT WILL NOT FLAG. THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN A RESULT IS OUTSIDE OF A LINEARITY LIMIT, IT DOES NOT HAPPEN WHEN THE RESULTS ARE BETWEEN THE LIMIT LOW AND LIMIT HIGH. THE ROOT CAUSE IS A VARIABLE WAS NOT CORRECTLY INITIALIZED. (B) (4).
1427936;1;THE GLUCOSE RESULT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE WRONG RECORD, THOUGH ON THE CORRECT PATIENT. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. THIS MDR IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE AS THIS IS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE UPDATED THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD AND THE UPDATE HAD RESULTED IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT THIS REPORTED COMPLAINT MEETS THE REPORTABILITY CRITERIA AS OUTLINED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT CONTROL RECORD FOR GE HEALTHCARE.

1427964;1;ON SELECTION OF ONE SPECIFIC PATIENT IN THE CENTRICITY RIS RADCOCKPIT MODULE'S WORKLIST, RA1000 OPENS IMAGES FOR A DIFFERENT PATIENT. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
1428006;1;ROOT CAUSE: THE CENTRICITY RIS-IC PRODUCT HAS A CONFIGURATION SECTION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE MODULE THAT ALLOWS AN ORGANIZATION TO SET PARAMETERS. IN THIS CASE, THE PARAMETERS AND VALIDATION FOR DEPARTMENT NUMBER DID NOT HAVE AN ALPHA CHARACTER SET AT THE FRONT OF IT (EX. - D0000001). WHEN THE MRN COUNTER AND THE DEPARTMENT NUMBER COUNTER CAUGHT UP WITH THE INITIAL MRN COUNTER, THE LACK OF AN ALPHA CHARACTER PREFIX ALLOWED A DEPARTMENT NUMBER TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER. CORRECTIONS: A SCRIPT WAS BUILT AND TESTED TO PLACE AN ALPHA CHARACTER PREFIX ON ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT NUMBERS IN THE RIS APPLICATION. A LIST OF PATIENTS FROM THE PACS DATABASE THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE WITH A CORRESPONDING DATA SET FROM THE RIS APPLICATION ALLOWED THE TEAMS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND VERIFY IMPACTED PATIENTS. THE PATIENT DATA COLLECTED FROM #2 ABOVE WAS USED TO RECREATE PATIENTS IN THE PACS DATABASE AND THEN THE CORRECT IMAGES COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND ATTACHED TO THE CORRECT PATIENT INFORMATION IN THE MASTER JACKETS. AT 3:00PM ON APRIL 13, 2009, THE PACS ENGINEER CONFIRMED THAT ALL PATIENTS NEEDING REMEDIATION HAD BEEN REMEDIATED. (B) (4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTED AN ISSUE IN WHICH PATIENTS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MERGED. THE RESULT OF THIS APPARENT CHANGE WAS THAT THE PATIENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCORRECT IMAGES IN THE CENTRICITY-PACS DATABASE. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.

WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AN ISI TECHNICAL SUPPORT ENGINEER (TSE), THE SITE POWERED DOWN THE SYSTEM, RESET THE BREAKER AND EMERGENCY POWERED OFF THE SYSTEM BEFORE EXERCISING THE RIGHT MASTER TOOL MANIPULATOR (MTMR) THROUGH ITS RANGE OF MOTION. THE SYSTEM WAS THEN POWERED ON AND THE FAULT REOCCURRED PRIOR TO HOMING. THE TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WERE REPEATED WITHOUT CHANGE. THE PROCEDURE HAD BEEN UNDERWAY FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS WHEN THE SURGEON DECIDED TO CONVERT TO TRADITIONAL OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUES TO COMPLETE THE PLANNED PROCEDURE. NO PT HARM WAS REPORTED. THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER CONCLUDED THAT SYSTEM ERROR CODE #212 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIGHT MASTER TOOL MANIPULATOR (MTMR). THE MASTER TOOL MANIPULATOR REFERS TO THE MASTER CONTROLLERS WHICH PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR THE SURGEON TO CONTROL THE INSTRUMENTS AND ENDOSCOPE INSIDE THE PT FROM THE SURGEON'S SIDE CONSOLE. ONE MTM IS ASSIGNED TO THE SURGEON'S LEFT HAND (MTML) AND ONE TO HIS RIGHT (MTMR). THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE AFFECTED MTMR. THE SYSTEM ALARMS (SYSTEM GENERATED FAULT CODE) FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED AND THERE WAS NO INJURY TO THE PT. SYSTEM ERROR CODE #212 OCCURS WHEN THE ACTUAL VOLTAGE TO DRIVE CURRENT THROUGH THE MOTORS DEVIATES FROM THE EXPECTED VOLTAGE BY A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. UPON DETERMINING THIS CONDITION, THE SAFETY SYSTEM PUTS DA VINCI IN A ""RECOVERABLE SAFE STATE"". THE MTMR WAS RETURNED TO ISI FOR EVALUATION. ENGINEERING WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF SYSTEM ERROR CODE #212, THUS CONFIRMING THE REPORTED FAILURE MODE EXPERIENCED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE MTMR AXIS 3 POTENTIOMETER, THE MOTOR/ENCODER ASSEMBLY, AND THE MOTOR HARNESS WERE REPLACED. AS OF JULY 30, 2009, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED RECURRENCES OF THE ISSUE AT THIS HOSPITAL."

1440388;0;"RESULT CODE- PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING COULD NOT DETERMINE A CONCLUSIVE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE STENT DISLODGEMENT. EVALUATION SUMMARY: QUALITY ASSURANCE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) WAS RETURNED WITH BLOOD IN THE GUIDE WIRE LUMEN. THERE WAS NO CONTRAST VISIBLE. THE STENT IMPLANT WAS DISLODGED FROM THE BALLOON AND NOT RETURNED. THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY FOLDER. THERE WERE CRIMP MARKS ON THE BALLOON WHERE THE STENT IMPLANT HAD BEEN BETWEEN THE MARKERS. THERE WERE NO KINKS NOTED TO THE INNER MEMBER OR THE TIP. THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE NOTED TO THE SDS. THE TIP SEAL LENGTH WAS MEASURED AND MET MANUFACTURING CRITERIA. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING REVIEWED THE INCIDENT INFO AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURN PRODUCT. THE INABILITY TO CROSS A LESION CAN BE AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, ANATOMICAL MORPHOLOGY, DISEASE STATE, PRE-DILATATION STRATEGY, PRODUCT SIZE SELECTION OR PLACEMENT, DAMAGE TO THE STENT IMPLANT OR THE SDS, INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER DEVICES, AND ACCESSORY DEVICE SUPPORT. FURTHERMORE, FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT STENT DISLODGEMENT INSIDE THE BODY INCLUDE, IMPROPER OR INADEQUATE CRIMPING AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE, POSITIVE PRESSURE DURING PREP, NEGATIVE PRESSURE DURING SHEATH REMOVAL OR FORCED SHEATH REMOVAL, INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER DEVICES, THE PT ANATOMY AND/OR A PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED STENT. NO PT ANATOMICAL INFO WAS PROVIDED, WHICH MAY HAVE AIDED THE EVALUATION. THE 2.25 X 13 PIXEL SDS WAS RETURNED WITH BLOOD VISIBLE IN THE GUIDE WIRE LUMEN, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DEVICE AT LEAST BEING LOADED ONTO A GUIDE WIRE DURING THE PROCEDURE. ALTHOUGH NO PT ANATOMICAL INFO WAS PROVIDED, IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DIRECTLY STENT THE LESION; HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PRODUCT'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) STATES TO PRE-DILATE THE LESION WITH A PTCA CATHETER PRIOR TO STENTING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE STENT BECAME DISRUPTED ON THE BALLOON WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ADVANCE AND RETRACT THE SDS THROUGH THE TIGHT LESION AND/OR THE GUIDING CATHETER, WHICH MAY HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED STENT DISLODGEMENT. SINCE THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY DAMAGE NOTED TO THE SDS OR THE STENT IMPLANT PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE AND BECAUSE NO PRE-DILATATION WAS PERFORMED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LESION CHARACTERISTICS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED, ALTHOUGH A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED. BASED ON THE INFO RECEIVED WITH THIS COMPLAINT AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED SDS, A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED FAILURE TO ADVANCE AND STENT DISLODGEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED, THOUGH THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY DEFICIENCY. A REVIEW OF THE FINISHED DEVICE LOT HISTORY RECORD DID NOT REVEAL ANY NONCONFORMING MATERIAL RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOT THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS COMPLAINT. THIS MDR IS CONSIDERED CLOSED BY THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE GROUP. REPORTING STATUS: SERIOUS INJURY- REQUIRED INTERVENTION- PERMANENT DAMAGE. REPORTING RATIONALE: DISLODGED STENT REMAINS IN PT. DEVICE ISSUE: STENT DISLODGEMENT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DIRECT STENT WITH A 2.25 X 13 MM PIXEL; HOWEVER, IT DID NOT CROSS THE LESION AND WAS REMOVED FOR PREDILATATION. DURING A SECOND CROSSING ATTEMPT, THE STENT DISLODGED AND WAS LOST IN THE PT. IT WAS LOCATED IN THE PERIPHERAL VASCULAR, WHERE IT REMAINS. THE LESION WAS LEFT WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY ONLY. NO ADDITIONAL EVENT OR PT INFO IS AVAILABLE."

THE TARGET LESION LOCATED IN THE RCA # 2-3 EXHIBITED 100% STENOSIS AND WAS PRE-DILATED. DURING THE SAME PROCEDURE, TWO OTHER ENDEAVOR RX DRUG-ELUTING CORONARY STENTS WERE DEPLOYED AT THE TARGET LESION. (REF. MFR REPORT# 2953200-2009-01181 - 01183). THE PHYSICIAN USED A SDS BALLOON TO POST DILATE THE LESION (AS CONTRAINDICATED IN THE ENDEAVOR RX INSTRUCTION FOR USE) WHICH HE INFLATED TO 18ATM'S - 2ATM'S ABOVE THE RBP. IT IS REPORTED THAT DURING POST-DILATATION ACTIVITIES, SLIGHT DISSECTION WAS CONFIRMED BETWEEN RCA # 3 AND RCA # 4; HOWEVER THE PHYSICIAN EVALUATED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO TREAT THE DISSECTION AS IT WAS SLIGHT. ONE DAY POST DEPLOYMENT, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF CHEST PAIN. ANGIOPLASTY CONFIRMED TOTAL OCCLUSION AROUND THE THREE ENDEAVOR RX DRUG-ELUTING CORONARY STENTS. THROMBUS WAS ASPIRED THEN THE LESION WAS DILATED AND A BARE METAL STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT DISSECTION PORTION. COMMUNICATION FROM THE FIELD CONFIRMED THAT THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THAT THIS THROMBOTIC EVENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY DISSECTION. THE PHYSICIAN ALSO COMMENTED THAT, AS THE LESION WAS POST-DILATED AT 18ATM (EXCEEDING RBP), THE DISSECTION MOST LIKELY OCCURRED DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE DILATATION. THE PHYSICIAN DENIED ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REPORTED EVENT AND THE RELEVANT DEVICE. THE PATIENT IS REPORTED TO BE FINE AND NO OTHER SEQUELAE WERE REPORTED. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT. THE ROOT CAUSE IS MOST LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE DISSECTION TOGETHER WITH THE LESION CONDITION; HOWEVER, STENT THROMBOSIS AND DISSECTION ARE LISTED IN THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS SECTION OF THE FOREIGN ENDEAVOR RX IFU AND ARE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EVERY STENTING PROCEDURE. SECONDARY INTERVENTION: THROMBUS WAS ASPIRED THEN THE LESION WAS DILATED WITH A BALLOON CATHETER AND A BARE METAL STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT DISSECTION PORTION. EVALUATION CODES, RESULTS: STENT THROMBOSIS, DISSECTION. THROMBOTIC TOTAL OCCLUSION. POST-DILATION BALLOON INFLATED TO 18 ATM WHICH EXCEEDS THE RBP. EVALUATION CODES, CONCLUSION: SDS BALLOON USED TO POST-DILATE, THE USE OF THIS DEVICE IS CONTRAINDICATED FOR PATIENTS WITH THROMBOTIC TOTAL OCCLUSION. THROMBOTIC TOTAL OCCLUSION."

ON MAY 22, 2009, THE LAY USER/PT CONTACTED LIFESCAN ALLEGING THE ONE TOUCH ULTRA LINK METER WAS READING INACCURATELY HIGH. THE MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE SPECIALIST CONTACTED THE PT TO OBTAIN/CLARIFY INFO. THE PT SAID THAT SHE STARTED FEELING SWEATY AND SHAKY AT ABOUT 10:30 PM ON (B) (6) BEFORE GOING TO BED. SHE HAD A PUDDING SNACK AND APPLE SAUCE AND FELT BETTER WITHIN 10-15 MINUTES. SHE THEN TESTED HER BLOOD SUGAR ON HER METER AND OBTAINED A RESULT OF 197 MG/DL ON HER METER AND 38 MG/DL ON ANOTHER METER. BASED ON STATISTICAL CRITERIA, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE RESULTS FALLS OUTSIDE THE EXPECTED VALUE OF <=30%. THE PT TESTS HER BLOOD SUGAR EIGHT TIMES PER DAY. SHE TAKES INSULIN BASED ON A PUMP REGIME AND INJECTS BOLUS INSULIN DOSES BASED ON THE PT'S READING, THE AMOUNT OF CARBOHYDRATES SHE TAKES, AND THE INSULIN ON BOARD, WHICH THE PUMP FIGURES OUT. PRIOR TO HAVING SYMPTOMS ON MAY 18, THE PT GOT READINGS OF 103 MG/DL AT 2 PM AND 138 MG/DL AT 6 PM AROUND DINNER. SHE DID NOT THINK THOSE READINGS WERE INACCURATELY HIGH AND SAID THEY ARE AROUND HER NORMAL READINGS. IT WAS DETERMINED DURING THE TROUBLESHOOTING TELEPHONE CALL, THE PT'S TESTING TECHNIQUE WAS CORRECT. THE TEST STRIPS WERE WITHIN EXPIRATION DATING AND IN GOOD CONDITION. THE CALIBRATION CODE ON THE METER MATCHED THE CODE ON THE TEST STRIP VIAL. TWO QUALITY CONTROL TESTS WERE PERFORMED, WITH PASSING RESULTS. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE, THE PT'S READING DID NOT CORRELATE WITH HER SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT. THE PRODUCT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO INJURY BECAUSE, THE SYMPTOMS STARTED BEFORE THE ALLEGED INACCURATE READING AND THE PT TOOK APPROPRIATE TREATMENT BASED ON HER SYMPTOMS, AND THE READING FROM THE OTHER METER.

1482213;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PT EXPERIENCED A FALL FOLLOWING ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. THE PT ALSO EXPERIENCED ITCHING. THE PT WAS WEARING A CAST, LOST THEIR BALANCE, AND FELL DOWNSTAIRS ONTO THE CEMENT 3-4 WEEKS AFTER THE SURGERY. THE PUMP WAS CHECKED OUT; ""EVERYTHING IS FINE"". ALSO, THE PT WAS NOW EXPERIENCING MIGRAINES WHICH WAS CONSIDERED A SEPARATE ISSUE, PER THE REPORTER. IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT AN UNDERDOSE WAS EXPERIENCED WITH PRURITUS AND INCREASED SPASTICITY. NO PUMP ALARMS OR OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES WERE NOTED. THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL VOLUME AND ACTUAL RESIDUAL VOLUMES MEASURED EQUALLY, SPECIFIC VALUES NOT REPORTED. THE INTRATHECAL DRUG PRESCRIPTION WAS CONFIRMED; THE CORRECT CONCENTRATION, DRUG, AND DOSE WERE PROGRAMMED. A THERAPEUTIC BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITHOUT RESPONSE. A DYE STUDY WAS ATTEMPTED; THE HCP WAS UNABLE TO ASPIRATE THE CATHETER. ADDITIONAL DEVICE TROUBLESHOOTING WAS BEING CONSIDERED. IN 2009, THE PT WENT TO THE HOSP DUE TO THE ITCHING, HEADACHES, AND INCREASED SPASTICITY. THE REPORTER NOTED THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHEN THEY HAVE INFECTION; NO INFECTION WAS FOUND IN RELATION TO THIS EVENT AFTER A BLOOD TEST. IN 2009, EXPLORATORY SURGERY WAS PERFORMED WHICH REVEALED THERE WAS NO ""FLOW"" OF MEDICATION INTO THE CATHETER. THE CATHETER WAS THEN ""FIXED"" AND THE PUMP WAS REPLACED DUE TO FALLS. ADDITIONAL INFO HAS BEEN REQUESTED FROM THE HCP, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT."
1482296;0;DURING PREPARATION FOR USE OF THE DEVICE FOR A CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS PROCEDURE, THE USER REPORTED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS TURNED OFF WHEN THE HEART LUNG CONSOLE WAS POWERED ON. THE DEVICE WAS USED FOR THE PROCEDURE. THE USER REPORTED THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. SINCE THE EVENT OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS, THERE WAS NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THE PATIENT AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. EVALUATION IS IN PROGRESS BUT NOT YET CONCLUDED.
1482543;0;THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE ANALYSIS IS THEREFORE, BASED ON THE INSPECTION OF THE QUALITY DOCUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS PARTICULAR DEVICE. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THIS DEVICE WAS RE-INVESTIGATED. ALL PRODUCTION STEPS HAD BEEN PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY INCONSISTENCY DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS WHICH MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. IN SUMMARY, THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE REVIEW OF THE QUALITY DOCUMENTS CONFIRMED A REGULAR DEVICE MANUFACTURING. BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFO THAT THIS PT'S LEAD WAS EXHIBITING LOSS OF CAPTURE NOTED ON THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAD WAS DISLODGED. THERE WERE NO PT SYMPTOMS REPORTED. THE PT'S WIFE ADMITTED THE PT HAD INCREASED ACTIVITY WITH HIS LEFT ARM DESPITE HIS PHYSICIAN'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO LIMIT USE OF HIS LEFT ARM. THE LEAD WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPOSITIONED, AND NO FURTHER ISSUES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM TO THIS DATE.
1482600;0;THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINED THAT THE DC POWER COIL HAD DAMAGED SHIELDING AND EXPOSED BARE WIRES. ALSO THE CUSTOMER FOUND THAT THE POWER SUPPLY BOARD HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY THE SHORTED POWER COIL. THE TECH REPLACED THE POWER SUPPLY BOARD AND THE DC POWER COIL, WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE BED WAS OPERATING WITHIN SPEC. PURSUANT TO OUR RESPONSE TO WARNING LETTER 2008-DT-04, HILL-ROM IS CONTINUING ITS RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF EVENTS FOR REPORTABILITY. THIS EFFORT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE ARE CURRENT.
1482839;1;USER REPORTED THAT THE SYSTEM COULD NOT BE USED BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM (EXCLAMATION SIGN ON SCREEN) AND THE REGISTRATION COULD NOT BE DONE. THE PT WAS UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA AND THE CASE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED WITH THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT. ON 08/25/2009, A SUPERDIMENSION SERVICE TECH WENT TO THE SITE TO CHECK THE SYSTEM AND REPORTED THAT THE LOCATABLE GUIDE CABLE, A COMPONENT OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING AN INTERMITTENT OPEN AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. ON 08/25/2009, A SUPERDIMENSION SERVICE TECHNICIAN WENT TO THE SITE TO CHECK THE SYSTEM AND REPORTED THAT A COMPONENT OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, THE LOCATABLE GUIDE CABLE (LG CABLE). THE LG CABLE WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS AND THE ANALYSIS IS PENDING. THE PROCEDURE IS TYPICALLY PERFORMED UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA. HOWEVER, THIS EVENT COMBINES A SUSPECTED MALFUNCTION THAT RENDERED THE SYSTEM UNAVAILABLE WITH A PT WHO WAS UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, THIS EVENT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE ADD'L POTENTIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO INJURY TO THE PT.
1482850;0;DURING THE REMOVAL OF THE PATIENT'S PORT CATHETER REMOVAL, THE CATHETER BROKE AND A PIECE OF THE CATHETER WAS RETAINED IN THE SVC. PATIENT HAD A CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION THROUGH THE RIGHT FEMORAL VEIN AND DURING THE PROCEDURE THEY WERE ABLE TO USE A GRASPER TO RETRIEVE THE PIECE OF THE CATHETER. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURING FOR EVALUATION. A CHR REVIEW IS NOT POSSIBLE, AS NO MANUFACTURING LOT NUMBER HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE COMPLAINANT.
1482943;1;"A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). CUSTOMER REPORTS THAT THE LAB INSTRUMENT, CURRENTLY CONFIGURED TO PERFORM PT, PTT, INR AND FIBRINOGEN TESTS. RESULTS IN A 0 (ZERO). THE 0 RESULT WAS CONVERTED TO "">200"" BY A LIBRARY CODE AND AUTO-ACCEPTED. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT."
1483018;1;THE CUSTOMER REPORTS THAT THE MRI IMAGES ARE REVERSED HORIZONTALLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE SERIES. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B) (4).
1483289;1;DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE WAND WAS NOT WORKING AND WAS DEFECTIVE. PHYSICIAN TRIED CHANGING THE BATTERY AND TESTED WAND WITH DIFFERENT HANDHELDS BUT IT WAS NOT WORKING. PHYSICIAN THINKS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BATTERY CONNECTION OF THE WAND. THE DEFECTED WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE WAND AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS CONFIRMED. THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, WHICH PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS, HAD INTERMITTENT CONDUCTORS AND THE RETURNED BATTERY WAS DEPLETED. A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE AND A KNOWN GOOD BENCH BATTERY WERE SUBSTITUTED. ALL COMMUNICATIONS ERRORS CLEARED. NO OTHER ANOMALY WAS OBSERVED.
1483294;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT DURING AN APPOINTMENT, THE MOTHER INQUIRED ABOUT THE PT'S MAGNETIC ACTIVATIONS. WHEN THE NURSE PRACTITIONER TRIED TO BRING UP THE MAGNETIC HISTORY ON THE HANDHELD COMPUTER, NO INFO CAME UP. THE NURSE THEN SAID THAT THEY TRIED SWIPING THE MAGNET BUT STILL NOTHING CAME UP ON THE SCREEN UNDER MAGNET HISTORY. DURING TROUBLESHOOTING WITH THE MFR, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE HANDHELD COMPUTER'S DATE WAS SET TO 2002. THE DATE WAS CHANGED AT THAT TIME TO THE CORRECT YEAR. WHEN THE NURSE TRIED TO REVIEW THE PT'S MAGNET HISTORY BY SEARCHING WITH THE PT'S GENERATOR SERIAL NUMBER, IT SHOWED TWO DIFFERENT PT'S INITIALS. THE NURSE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE PT'S INFO IN THE HANDHELD COMPUTER. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFO HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1483458;0;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THERE WAS NO IMAGE ON THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM OPERATES AS INTENDED. (B) (4). THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED, FOUND TO BE OPERATING AS INTENDED, AND RELEASED TO THE CUSTOMER FOR USE.
1483657;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LAP GASTRIC BYPASS PROCEDURE, THE SURGEON OBSERVED THERE WAS MORE VAPOR AND SMOKE COMPARED TO OTHER CASES WHEN GOING ACROSS FATTY TISSUE. THERE WAS A BUSSING NOISE AT THE END OF THE TIP AND THE HANDLE NEEDED TO BE TORQUED DURING THIS ISSUE. THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE AND SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE BLADE. ANOTHER DEVICE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE TO THE PT REPORTED. (B) (4). (B) (4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE BLADE SCRATCHED AND CRACKED. DURING FUNCTIONAL TESTING, AN ERROR CODE 5 WAS DISPLAYED AND THE BLADE TIP FURTHER CRACKED. THE DEVICE WILL STOP ACTIVATING, AND EITHER EMIT A SOLID TONE OR DISPLAY AN INSTRUMENT ERROR CODE 5 OR A SOLID TONE ON THE GENERATOR DISPLAY WHEN THE BLADE BECOMES DAMAGED. WHEN A BLADE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED SUCH AS SCRATCHED OR CRACKED, THE TITANIUM METAL IS FATIGUED WHEN CONTINUALLY ENERGIZED AND THIS RESULTS IN THE BLADE FURTHER CRACKING AND POSSIBLY BREAKING OFF. A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF AN ERROR CODE 5 (INSTRUMENT ERROR) IS BLADE DAMAGE. BLADE DAMAGE MAY OCCUR FROM EXTERNAL CONTACT WITH METAL OR PLASTIC DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE. EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT, AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT THIS PROCESS. THE BATCH HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED DURING THE MFG PROCESS.
1483900;0;CURRENTLY, IT IS UNK WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN RETURNED, BUT NOT YET EVALUATED. FURTHER INFO WILL FOLLOW ONCE THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT HE WAS TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND HAVING SEIZURES. THE CUSTOMER'S BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS 45 MG/DL WHEN HIS WIFE FOUND HIM. THE CUSTOMER'S WIFE TREATED HIM WITH A GLUCAGON, THEN TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED AND THE INSULIN PUMP WAS PROGRAMMED CORRECTLY. HOWEVER, THE BOLUS AND BASAL RATE HISTORY DID NOT MATCH WITH THE DAILY TOTALS. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED.
1484027;0;EVAL SUMMARY: THE EVAL DID NOT CONFIRM ANY FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE DEVICE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS IIPV DISCOVERED DURING EVAL. BASED ON A REVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE THERAPY LOG DATA, THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE IIPV WAS DETERMINED TO BE INSUFFICIENT DRAIN, ONE OR MORE CYCLES ADVANCES TO THE NEXT FILL WHEN SLOW/NO FLOW OCCURRED ABOVE THE MINIMUM DRAIN VOLUME THRESHOLD. THE DEVICE WILL BE ROUTED TO THE SERVICE AREA. CAPA IS CURRENTLY OPEN FOR THE REPORTABLE MALFUNCTION OF OVERDELIVERY. DURING EVAL OF THE RETURNED HOMECHOICE MACHINE, AN INCREASED INTRAPERITONEAL VOLUME (IIPV) WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE THERAPY THAT STARTED IN 2009 DURING CYCLE 3. THE ULTRAFILTRATION WAS 1600ML INDICATING THE HOME PT (HP) DRAINED 1600ML MORE THAN THEIR PROGRAMMED FILL VOLUME OF 2400ML. THIS INFO GIVES TOTAL DRAIN VOLUME OF 4000ML. (1600ML+2400ML=4000ML). THIS MEETS THE IIPV CRITERIA. PRODUCT SURVEILLANCE CONTACTED THE PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (PD) NURSE TWO MONTHS LATER, REGARDING THE REPORTED CASE OF IIPV. THE NURSE STATED SHE DID NOT HAVE ANY INFO REGARDING THE IIPV. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CONDITION. THERE WERE NO SYMPTOMS THAT WERE REPORTED DURING THIS TIME THAT WOULD INDICATE AN IIPV EVENT. THE NURSE STATED THE HP IS CURRENTLY DOING WELL ON THERAPY.
1484362;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE INSULIN PUMP ALARMED MOTOR ERROR. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, AND THE DISPLACEMENT TEST FAILED. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. CURRENTLY, IT IS UNK WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. THE DEVICE WILL BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS AND FURTHER INFO WILL FOLLOW ONCE THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
1484516;0;COMPLAINANT ALLEGED THAT DURING A ROUTINE SHIFT CHECK BY A CLINICIAN, THE DEVICE WOULD NOT POWER UP. COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO PT INVOLVEMENT IN THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION. THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION WAS OBSERVED AND ATTRIBUTED TO A FAULTY FUSE ON THE BATTERY INTERCONNECT BOARD. ANALYSIS OF REPORTS OF THIS TYPE HAS NOT IDENTIFIED AN INCREASE IN TREND.
1484626;0;"ADD'L INFO WAS REQUESTED BUT TO DATE NO RESPONSES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND NO ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RELATE TO THIS COMPLAINT. THE DHR CONFIRMS THE COIL MET ALL MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS UPON ITS RELEASE. UPON RECEIPT OF THE COIL, IT WAS NOTED TO BE EXCESSIVELY STRETCHED AND ATTACHED TO APPROXIMATELY 5 CM OF THE PUSHERWIRE. APPROX 2 CM OF THE COIL REMAINED UNDAMAGED AT THE DISTAL END. THE REMAINDER OF THE PUSHERWIRE WAS NOT RETURNED. MICROSCOPIC INSPECTION SHOWED THE FORM TIP BALL TO BE ROUND AND SMOOTH. THE DETACHMENT GAP WAS ALSO NOTED TO BE INTACT AND SHOWED THE PROXIMAL SECTION OF THE PUSHERWIRE. THE PUSHERWIRE AND SURROUNDING PET WERE NOTED TO BE COMPLETELY BROKEN APPROX 5CM FROM THE DISTAL END. ALL DIMENSIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE STRETCHED PORTION OF THE COIL WERE FOUND TO BE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. ADD'L INFO WAS REQUESTED FROM THE USER FACILITY REGARDING THIS EVENT. TO DATE, NO RESPONSES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. HOWEVER, THE EVENT DESCRIPTION STATES THE COIL WAS REPOSITIONED SEVERAL TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEPLOY THE COIL. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS REPEATED REPOSITIONING LED TO THE COIL STRETCHING. THE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU) FOR THIS PRODUCT STATES ""IF MATRIX2 DETACHABLE COIL REPOSITIONING IS NECESSARY, TAKE SPECIAL CARE TO RETRACT COIL UNDER FLUOROSCOPY IN A ONE-TO-ONE MOTION WITH THE DELIVERY WIRE. IF THE COIL DOES NOT MOVE WITH ONE-TO-ONE MOTION, OR REPOSITIONING IS DIFFICULT, THE COIL HAS BEEN STRETCHED AND COULD POSSIBLY BREAK. GENTLY REMOVE AND DISCARD BOTH THE CATHETER AND COIL."" THE DFU ALSO STATES ""DUE TO THE DELICATE NATURE OF THE MATRIX 2 DETACHABLE COILS, THE TORTUOUS VASCULAR PATHWAYS THAT LEAD TO CERTAIN ANEURYSMS AND VESSELS, AND THE VARYING MORPHOLOGIES OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS, A COIL MAY OCCASIONALLY STRETCH WHILE BEING MANEUVERED. STRETCHING IS A PRECURSOR TO POTENTIAL MALFUNCTIONS, SUCH AS COIL BREAKAGE AND MIGRATION"". IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE CATHETERS HAD BEEN STEAM SHAPED SEVERAL TIMES WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE ACCEPTABLE USE OF A MICROCATHETER AND LIKELY CAUSED THE ISSUES EXPERIENCED WITH THE COIL. THEREFORE, BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE AND LIMITED INFO, THE ROOT CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE RELATED TO THE IMPROPER USE OF THE MICROCATHETER. IT WAS REPORTED THE PHYSICIAN WAS PERFORMING A COIL EMBOLIZATION ON TWO ANEURYSMS IN THE RIGHT AND LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERIES (ICA). THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED HAVING EXPERIENCED FRICTION WHILE TRYING TO DEPLOY THE COIL INTO THE ICA. THE COIL WAS ADVANCED AND RETRACTED IN THE ANEURYSM SEVERAL TIMES AND RESISTANCE WAS FELT. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRACT THE COIL SLOWLY, BUT THE COIL STRETCHED. THE COIL WAS SUCCESSFULLY RETRIEVED BY RETRACTING IT INSIDE THE MICROCATHETER AND REMOVING IT FROM THE PT. THE PT IS REPORTED TO BE FINE. UPON RECEIPT OF THE COIL, THE PUSHERWIRE AND SURROUNDING PET WERE NOTED TO BE COMPLETELY BROKEN APPROX 5 CM FROM THE DISTAL END."
1484997;1;THE SITE EXPERIENCED AN EVENT IN MAKING THE DICTATION SOFTWARE OPEN DUE TO A MISTAKE IN CONFIGURATION (THEY WERE MOVING SERVER FROM OLD HARDWARE TO NEW HARDWARE AND ONE OF THE CONFIGURATION FILES WASN'T COPIED OVER). THE ISSUE WAS FIXED AFTER THE SYSTEM WAS PROPERLY CONFIGURED. (B)(4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTS WHEN SELECTING DICTATE IN PACS, IT'S NOT POPULATING CORRECT PT NAME. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.
1484998;1;A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4). CUSTOMER REPORTS INCORRECT SPACIAL MARKERS ON IMAGES IN RA1000. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.

1485011;0;"A REPORT WAS RECEIVED THAT DURING A CATH LAB EVALUATION OF DURASTAR PTCA BALLOONS, ""THE COMMON PERCEPTION WAS THAT THE DEFLATION TIME WAS SLOWER WITH DURASTAR THAN WITH OTHER BALLOONS WE TESTED IN OUR LAB. WE HAD NO FAILURE TO DEFLATE AND NO CASES IN WHICH THE DEFLATION TIME HAD ANY CLINICAL IMPACT OTHER THAN A FEW EXTRA SECONDS WAITING FOR THE BALLOON TO APPEAR FULLY DEFLATED FOR WITHDRAWAL"". THE REPORTER FURTHER STATED THAT ""OBSERVATIONS ABOUT DEFLATION TIME REPRESENT A GENERAL PERCEPTION AND SOMETHING BENCH TESTING OF THE PRODUCT IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER PRODUCTS MIGHT ALSO IDENTIFY. PUT ANOTHER WAY, THE DEFLATION TIME OF THE DURASTAR IS ONLY AVERAGE AND SOME OF THE NEWER NON-COMPLIANT BALLOONS WE TESTED HAD VERY RAPID DEFLATION TIMES THAT WE ENJOYED"". ALTHOUGH THE REPORTER REITERATED THAT THIS WAS NOT A PRODUCT COMPLAINT AND NO PATIENT INJURY HAD OCCURRED, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO ERR ON THE SIDE ON BEING CONSERVATIVE AND LOG THE EVENTS AS COMPLAINTS. NO PRODUCTS WERE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. THE SLOW DEFLATION COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED WITHOUT A PRODUCT RETURN. BASED ON THE REPORT'S STATEMENT THAT NO PRODUCT FAILURE OCCURRED, NO ACTIONS APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY AT THIS TIME."
1485016;1;"THE REPORTED ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE ""?"" AND SIZE OF THE NEW MARKERS PRESENTED TO THE END USER AFTER APPLYING UPGRADE. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.

1485451;0;LIFESCAN (LFS) HAS REQUESTED RETURN OF THE SUBJECT PRODUCT(S) FOR EVALUATION. IF THE PRODUCT(S) ARE RETURNED, LFS WILL EVALUATE IT/THEM, AND INFORM FDA OF PRODUCT(S) THAT DO NOT PASS INSPECTION IN A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. ON SEP 10, 2009, THE LAY-USER/ REPORTER CONTACTED LIFESCAN ON BEHALF OF HER MOTHER (THE PT) ALLEGING THAT A ONE TOUCH ULTRA METER HAD AN UNK ERROR MESSAGE ISSUE. THE REPORTER WAS UNABLE TO SPECIFY WHAT EXACT MESSAGE WAS OR HAD APPEARED. THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT THE PT DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS OF FREQUENT URINATION ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE ALLEGED ISSUE BEGAN. IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT DATE/TIME THE REPORTED ISSUE BEGAN, ALTHOUGH SHE ALLEGED THAT THE SYMPTOMS DEVELOPED AFTER THE ISSUE STARTED. AS A RESULT OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE, THE REPORTER MENTIONED THAT THE PT INCREASED HER MEDICATION DOSAGE(S). SHE TOOK 2 UNSPECIFIED PILLS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER, THE PT DID NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE PT'S TESTING FREQUENCY, HER MEDICATION AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT REGIMENS, WHAT TIME THE ALLEGED ISSUE BEGAN, WHAT TIME THE SYMPTOMS STARTED, WHAT HER LAST BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS BEFORE THE ISSUE STARTED, AND WHAT DATE/TIME THE LAST READING WAS OBTAINED. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO KNOW WHAT ACTIONS THE PT TOOK BEFORE AND AFTER THE SYMPTOMS DEVELOPED. THE REPORTED ISSUE WAS RESOLVED WITH TROUBLESHOOTING. THE METER AND TEST STRIPS WERE REPLACED. BASED ON THE INFO PROVIDED, THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE REPORTER CLAIMED THAT THE PT DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SERIOUS INJURY AFTER THE ALLEGED METER ISSUE BEGAN.
1485549;1;IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEY WERE HAVING SCREEN FREEZE PROBLEM WITH THEIR HANDHELD DURING SURGERY. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE TEMPORARILY BUT THEN IT WOULD FREEZE AGAIN. NEW PROGRAMING SYSTEM WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND THE OLD ONE WAS RETURNED BACK TO MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. THE MFR HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND NO OBVIOUS ANOMALY WAS NOTICED. NO ANOMALY WAS FOUND WITH THE WAND AND IT PERFORMED AS INTENDED. ANALYSIS ON THE FLASHCARD WAS COMPLETED AND THE SCREEN FREEZE EVENT WAS DUPLICATED. THE MFR HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER.
1485552;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE DEVICE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1485555;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHILE SEEING THE PT, THE REPORTER COULD NOT GET HER HANDHELD COMPUTER PAST THE ALIGN SCREEN. SHE STATED THAT IT WAS PLUGGED IN PRIOR TO TRYING TO GET THE INTERROGATE SCREEN, BUT NOW IT'S UNPLUGGED AND IT WON'T GO PAST THE ALIGN SCREEN. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. PRODUCT HAS BEEN REQUESTED, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO DATE.
1485559;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD DEVICE WOULD FREEZE UPON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. THE PHYSICIAN WOULD RE-SEAT THE FLASHCARD TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DEVICE REPLACED.

1486327;0;NO PT CONSEQUENCES WERE REPORTED. ONE USED CATHETER WAS RECEIVED ON 7/13/2009. THE RETURNED CATHETER WAS VISUALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY EXAMINED. THERE WAS A INTERMITTENT SHORT CONFIRMED WITH ELECTRODE BAND #4. THE CATHETER WAS SYSTEMATICALLY DISSECTED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE. NO ISSUES WERE FOUND AT THE CATHETER CONNECTOR. FURTHER DISSECTION NOTED INSULATION DAMAGE ON THE CONDUCTING WIRE CONNECTED TO ELECTRODE BAND #4. THE CONDUCTOR WIRES CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRODE BANDS ARE COATED WITH QUAD LAYER INSULATION TO PREVENT CONTACT WITH THE OTHER INTERNAL COMPONENTS AND WITH EACH OTHER. ADD'L INSULATION COVERS THE CONDUCTOR WIRES TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE WIRES FROM OTHER INTERNAL COMPONENTS. IN THIS CASE, THE INSULATION BECAME DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE CONDUCTOR WIRE #4 BEING ABRADED AGAINST THE INTERNAL FLAT WIRE DURING REPEATED DEFLECTION OF THE CATHETER. ONCE THE INSULATION GETS DAMAGED, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR CONTACT AND A SHORT CIRCUIT BETWEEN THE CONDUCTOR WIRE AND INTERNAL FLAT WIRE. SINCE THE INTERNAL FLAT WIRE IS IN CONTACT WITH THE TIP ELECTRODE (#1), THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A SHORT CONDITION BETWEEN ELECTRODES #4 AND THE TIP. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR LOT NUMBER 55566 WAS REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT EACH MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION OPERATION WERE PERFORMED AND REPORTED AS COMPLETE AND ACCEPTABLE. NO EVIDENCE OF MANUFACTURING ERROR COULD BE FOUND. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS HIGH IMPEDANCE NOTED ON THE BIOSENSE WEBSTER STOCKERT GENERATOR AND WHEN THE PHYSICIAN REMOVED THE CATHETER FROM THE PT, CHAR WAS OBSERVED ON THE 4TH ELECTRODE. NO PT CONSEQUENCES.
1486445;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH A PATIENT'S VNS. HE OBTAINED A FAULT MESSAGE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION TO RETRY.

THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A TYPE I PROXIMAL ENDOLEAK AND ACUTE EXPANSION OF THEIR ANEURYSM SAC. THE PHYSICIAN IMPLANTED A ZENITH TX2 TAA ENDOVASCULAR GRAFT SINGLE PROXIMAL EXTENSION PIECE INTO THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED THORACOABDOMINAL ANEURYSM. POST-OPERATIVELY, THERE WAS COMPLETE ANGIOGRAPHIC RESOLUTION OF THE TYPE I ENDOLEAK AND THE PATIENT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE. THE PHYSICIAN STATED THE TYPE I ENDOLEAK WAS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE GORE TAG THORACIC ENDOPROSTHESIS, BUT TO PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING PAPERWORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. RESULTS - THE REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING PAPERWORK VERIFIED THAT THIS LOT MET ALL PRE-RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS.
1486950;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED POSITIONAL STIMULATION AND A LACK OF THERAPEUTIC EFFECT. THE PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO FEEL STIMULATION WHILE LAYING DOWN AND COULD SOMETIMES FEEL STIMULATION WHILE SITTING UP. POSITIONAL CHANGES AFFECTED STIMULATION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED FROM THE HCP, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. (B) (4)
1487216;0;"AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE HOSPITAL DISCARDED THE PRODUCT. A LOT HISTORY RECORD REVIEW WAS COMPLETED FOR THE PRODUCT, AND THERE WAS NO NONCONFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOT NUMBER. (B) (4). THE HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF ENDOSCOPIC VEIN HARVESTING PROCEDURES, FIVE SHORT PORT BTT BALLOONS WOULD NOT HOLD AIR DUE TO THE INFLATION BLACK VALVES DISLODGED. THE PROCEDURES WERE COMPLETED USING ACCESSORY BTT SHORT PORTS. THE HOSPITAL DID NOT REPORT ANY PATIENT COMPLICATIONS. THE FIVE BTT WERE USED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF PROCEDURES; HOWEVER, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES AND DATES WERE UNKNOWN. THIS REPORT IS FOR THE FOURTH DEVICE."
1487505;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT A (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER EXPERIENCED A SCREEN FREEZE. A HARD AND SOFT RESET WAS PERFORMED BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. THE HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND UNDERWENT PRODUCT ANALYSIS. PRODUCT ANALYSIS REVEALED NO FAILURE WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE HANDHELD AND THE DEVICE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. MOREOVER, AN ANALYSIS ON THE FLASHCARD REVEALED THAT DURING THE ANALYSIS, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE SOFTWARE WOULD PAUSE FOR 14 SECONDS FOLLOWING INTERROGATION AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THIS IS EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CONSIDERING THE DATABASE SIZE. FURTHERMORE, NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, IT IS KNOWN THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE REPORTED SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) COMPUTER.
1487506;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO MANUFACTURING CONSULTANT THAT THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH PROGRAMMING WAND. REPORTED THE BATTERY WAS CHANGED TWICE, THE GREEN LIGHT BUT NOT ORANGE COMES ON. THE HANDHELD WORKS WITH ANOTHER PROGRAMMING WAND. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE FOR PRODUCT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.
1487509;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO THEIR VNS CONSULTANT THAT THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER SCREEN FREEZING AT THE INTERROGATION SCREEN. A RESET DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD AND (B) (4) PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE WERE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. TESTING ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD SHOWED IT WAS OPERATING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE FLASHCARD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS NOT CONFIRMED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.
1487510;1;IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEIR HANDHELD SCREEN HAS BEEN FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER. NEW HANDHELD IS BEING SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND NO OBVIOUS ANOMALY WAS NOTICED. ANALYSIS ON THE FLASHCARD WAS COMPLETED AND THE SCREEN FREEZE EVENT WAS NOT DUPLICATED. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER.
1487628;0;NO COMPLAINT AGAINST PRODUCT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT SURGEON INSERTED A CC4204BF COLLAMER PLATE LENS AND DID NOT LIKE THE WAY IT SEATED IN THE EYE. THE LENS WAS REMOVED AND A DIFFERENT SIZE LENS WAS IMPLANTED. NO PATIENT INJURY. THE REPORTER STATED THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE LENS BUT A SURGEON'S PREFERENCE.
1487809;1;DEVICE EVAL: SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE EVAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM THAT OCCURRED WHEN A USER DID NOT PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE DONOR SEARCH AS REQUIRED BY FACILITY PROCEDURES. THE ISSUE WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPLOAD OF THE MOBILE COLLECTION DONATION INFO TO SAFETRACE. THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SOFTWARE IS APPENDING AN EXTRA SPACE TO A DONOR'S FIRST NAME WHEN A DONOR RECORD IS CREATED WITH A MIDDLE NAME OR MIDDLE INITIAL AND THEN UPLOADED. ALL OTHER POSSIBLE BRANCHES OF THE PROGRAM WERE REVIEWED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE EXTRA SPACE WILL ONLY BE APPENDED IF THE DONOR RECORD IS CREATED WITH A MIDDLE NAME OR MIDDLE NAME INITIAL. ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS COULD BE IMPACTED. THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION WAS VERIFIED AND VALIDATED. THE SCOPE OF THE TESTING INCLUDED THE SOFTWARE MODIFICATION ITSELF, ALL POTENTIALLY IMPACTED AREAS OF THE SOFTWARE, AND OTHER REGRESSION TESTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FIX WAS EFFECTIVE AND DID NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SOFTWARE. THE TESTED SOFTWARE IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS THE WEEK OF AUG 10, 2009. IN AN SPECIFIC SCENARIO, A TRUE DUPLICATE DONOR RECORD MAY NOT BE FLAGGED AS A DUPLICATE. THIS PROBLEM CAN OCCUR IF A NEW DONOR RECORD IS CREATED AT A MOBILE COLLECTION AND AT THE NEXT DONATION ANOTHER NEW DONOR RECORD (FOR THE SAME PERSON) IS CREATED AT A MOBILE OR NON-MOBILE COLLECTION, AND THE DONATION RECORDS CONTAIN DIFFERENT IDENTIFYING INFO, AND THE USER DOES NOT FOLLOW USER FACILITY PROCEDURE TO PERFORM A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH FOR THE DONOR BEFORE CREATING A NEW DONOR RECORD. DIFFERENT IDENTIFYING INFO COULD INCLUDE RECORDING A SSN AND A MIDDLE NAME INITIAL AT THE MOBILE COLLECTION, WHILE RECORDING A DRIVER'S LICENCE # AND FULL MIDDLE NAME AT THE SUBSEQUENT COLLECTION. IF THE DONOR RECORD IS CREATED FIRST AT A NON-MOBILE COLLECTION AND THEN THE SECOND DONOR RECORD IS CREATED AT A MOBILE COLLECTION THEN THE PROBLEM CANNOT OCCUR. THE PROBLEM ALSO DOES NOT OCCUR IF THE FACILITY USES AN EXISTING TABLE SETTING THAT USES ADDITIONAL CRITERIA TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE DUPLICATE DONORS. AS A WORKAROUND, THE USER FACILITIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH A TOOL TO MITIGATE THE ISSUE. IN ADDITION, AN URGENT SOFTWARE FIX HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. A SAFETY ADVISORY, WHICH INCLUDED THE WORKAROUND, ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SOFTWARE FIX, AND A RECOMMENDATION TO REVIEW LABELING AND SOPS WAS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS.
1488283;0;"THE INDEPENDENT NURSE CONSULTANT COMPLETED HER VISIT IN 2009. THE CUSTOMER WAS ADVISED THAT ALCON DOES NOT RECOMMEND RE-USING A SINGLE USE DEVICE. A COPY OF THE DIRECTIONS FOR USE FOR THE PHACO HANDPIECE AND A COPY OF THE ""RECOMMENDED PRACTICES FOR CLEANING AND STERILIZING INTRAOCULAR SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS"" WERE SENT TO THE CUSTOMER. THE NURSE CONSULTANT IDENTIFIED SEVERAL POTENTIAL SOURCES OF TASS FROM CLEANING AND HANDLING PROTOCOL INCLUDING INADEQUATE MANUAL CLEANING OF INSTRUMENTATION AND DEVIATING FROM PHACO HANDPIECE DFU. THE FACILITY USES ENZYMATIC CLEANER IN THE INSTRUMENT CLEANING PROCESS AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT IS NEUTRALIZED OR APPROPRIATELY REMOVED OF RESIDUALS, AS RECOMMENDED IN THE PHACO HANDPIECE DFU. THE FACILITY USES A SANI-CLOTH TO WIPE THE OUTSIDE OF THE PHACO HANDPIECE AND CORD. CHEMICALS ON THE CLOTH USED TO WIPE THE HANDPIECE COULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE HANDPIECE TO OTHER INSTRUMENTS. THE FACILITY HAS PREVIOUSLY USED A WASHER/STERILIZER TO CLEAN INSTRUMENTS. DETERGENT OR ENZYMATIC CLEANER OR INSTRUMENT LUBRICANT MAY LEAVE RESIDUALS. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF BACTERIAL GROWTH ON INSTRUMENTS AND IN LUMENS ON TRAYS LEFT OVERNIGHT WITHOUT TERMINAL STERILIZATION. THE FACILITY RE-USES SINGLE USE ITEMS, AGAINST WHAT IS RECOMMENDED ON PACKAGE LABELING, OPERATOR'S MANUAL, AND DFU. THE FACILITY PLACES BETADINE ON THE EYE AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. BETADINE IS NOT INDICATED FOR INTRAOCULAR USE, AND MAY POTENTIALLY LEAK THROUGH THE INCISION. THE FACILITY USES PRESERVED EYE DROPS OR OINTMENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE. PRESERVATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF TASS, AS PER THE ASCRS/ASORN TASS TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE SITE VISIT REPORT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FACILITY BY THE NURSE CONSULTANT. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS FOR THE LAST 24 MONTHS DID NOT INDICATE ANY ADDITIONAL RELATED REPORTS FOR THIS SYSTEM OR HANDPIECE. ALCON'S INVESTIGATION, ""INVESTIGATION INTO INCREASED REPORTS OF TASS (TOXIC ANTERIOR SEGMENT SYNDROME)"", CONCLUDED THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT TASS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF AN ALCON PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, A TASS TASK FORCE, UNDER LEADERSHIP OF A DR, MET ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND COMPILED DATA REGARDING THE INCREASED INCIDENCE OF TASS CASES. THE TASS TASK FORCE FINAL REPORT DATED SEPTEMBER 22, 2006, FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA TO SUGGEST THAT ANY ONE PRODUCT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN TASS CASES THAT WERE REPORTED. CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DID NOT REVEAL A SINGLE CAUSE OR POINT SOURCE RELATED TO THIS TASS OUTBREAK. THEIR INVESTIGATION FAILED TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE SUPPORTING AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A SHARED PRODUCT AND THE CASES OF TASS REPORTED. THIS REPORT WAS MAILED TO FDA ON: 09/30/2009. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED INCIDENTS OF TASS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HER. ALL CASES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE SURGEONS INVOLVED. THE CUSTOMER STATED THE EVENTS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING SINCE 2007, BUT THE CASES WERE NEVER REPORTED TO ALCON. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT AT THE END OF EACH CASE, EACH HANDPIECE PORT IS FLUSHED WITH 30-40CC OF STERILE WATER. THE COMPANY CONSUMER AFFAIRS ANALYST ADVISED HER THAT THE STAFF IS NOT FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS FOR USE (DFU) FOR THE HANDPIECES (120CC OF STERILE OR DISTILLED WATER IN EACH PORT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY). THE CUSTOMER FURTHER STATED THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE HANDPIECES ARE TRANSPORTED TO CENTRAL STERILIZATION (EYE INSTRUMENTS/HANDPIECES ARE NOT MIXED WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS) WHERE THEY ARE HAND WASHED WITH A DETERGENT AND THAT THE DETERGENT IS DILUTED PER MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATIONS. SHE STATED THAT THE DETERGENT IS NOT USED IN THE HANDPIECE PORTS. EACH PORT IS THEN FLUSHED WITH 120CC OF STERILE WATER AND AIR BLOWN UNTIL DRY. NO LUBRICANTS ARE USED ON THE HANDPIECES. THE CUSTOMER CONFIRMED THAT THEIR AUTOCLAVE PERFORMANCE/FUNCTION AND THEIR WATER QUALITY ARE CHECKED ON A PRESCRIBED TIME SCHEDULE AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS CHECKED OUT FINE. THE HANDPIECES ARE FLASH STERILIZED AT 270 DEGREES FOR 10 MINUTES BETWEEN CASES. THEY DO RE-USE THE PHACO TIPS 5 TIMES EACH; THE PHACO TIP IS A SINGLE USE DEVICE. THEY MARK THE WRENCH EACH TIME IT IS STERILIZED AND DISCARD AFTER THE 5TH USE. THE CUSTOMER SAID THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH CLOUDY/PARTICULATES BSS AND THAT THEY USE A FILTERED NEEDLE TO ADD EPINEPHRINE TO THE BSS. THE CUSTOMER REQUESTED A SITE VISIT FROM AN INDEPENDENT NURSE CONSULTANT TO ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING THE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF TASS. THIS REPORT IS ONE OF SIX REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT."
1488972;0;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE UNIT FAILED THE PADDLES INDICATOR TEST. THE CUSTOMER EVALUATED THE DEVICE AND ISOLATED THE PROBLEM TO THE POWER PCA. REPLACING THE POWER PCA RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE UNIT WAS PUT BACK INTO SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE UNIT FAILED THE PADDLES INDICATOR TEST.
1489015;1;IN 2008, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE ECG DATA THAT WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE HOLTER APPLICATION DID NOT MATCH WHAT WAS BEING DISPLAYED BY THE PATIENT MONITORING PIC (IIC) PHILIPS INFORMATION SYSTEM. IN 2008, THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE ECG DATA THAT WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE HOLTER APPLICATION DID NOT MATCH WHAT WAS BEING DISPLAYED BY THE PATIENT MONITORING PIC (IIC) PHILIPS INFORMATION SYSTEM. IN DECEMBER OF 2008, PHILIPS EVALUATED DATA PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A MALFUNCTION, WHERE THE TIME STAMPS ON THE EXPORTED HOLTER ECG FILE DID NOT MATCH THE SCREEN CAPTURE OF THE PIC (IIC) PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE DATA DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MISSING OR ALTERED IN ANY OTHER WAY. NOTE THAT NO DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO PHILIPS, BUT SAMPLE ECG FILED WERE RETURNED TO PHILIPS FOR EVALUATION.
1489515;0;THE USER STATED SHE WAS SEEING HIGH BICARBONATE RESULTS THAT REPEATED NORMAL ON THE 911 ANALYZER. THE USER PROVIDED RESULTS FROM THREE PT SAMPLES. ALL RESULTS ARE IN MMOL PER L. SAMPLE 1 INITIAL RESULT WAS 42.3, REPEAT RESULT WAS 25.8. SAMPLE 2 INITIAL RESULT WAS 49.9, REPEAT RESULT WAS 28.3. SAMPLE 3 INITIAL RESULT WAS 42.5, REPEAT RESULT WAS 26.1. NO PT RESULTS WERE SENT OUT AND NO PTS WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. NO OTHER ASSAYS WERE AFFECTED. THE FIELD SERVICE REP DETERMINED THERE WAS A MISADJUSTED R1 PROBE AND ADJUSTED AND REALIGNED IT. TO VERIFY THE ANALYZER OPERATION, HE OBSERVED THE OPERATION WITH NO ERRORS AND PERFORMED CALIBRATION, QC AND A PRECISION TEST.

ALL ATTEMPTS FOR FURTHER INFO AND ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE PRODUCT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. THE HANDHELD WAS RETURNED WITHOUT THE 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. IT WAS RETURNED WITH 8.0 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE ORIGINAL EVENT WAS REPORTED IN (B)(4) 2009 AND SINCE THAT TIME THE HANDHELD HAD A SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO 8.0 SOFTWARE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE EVENT WAS STILL CONTINUING. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE RETURNED 8.0 FLASHCARD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS NOT VERIFIED. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD WERE NOTED IN PRODUCT ANALYSIS DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. THE HANDHELD PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS. THE EVENT IS STILL SUSPECTED TO BE RELATED TO THE 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE THAT WAS NOT RETURNED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT THE ENTIRE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM IS BEING RETURNED BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING. AT THIS TIME IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS.
1494606;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD WOULD FREEZE DURING INTERROGATION. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE. HOWEVER, IT WAS THEN REPORTED THAT THE NEW HANDHELD WOULD GIVE THE SAME PROBLEM. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WERE PERFORMED ON THE OLD WAND AND THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RESOLVED. DIFFERENT WAND WAS TRIED ON THE NEW HANDHELD AND THE SITE COULD SUCCESSFULLY INTERROGATE A DEMO GENERATOR. SAME WAND WAS THEN CONNECTED TO THE OLD HANDHELD AND INTERROGATION WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE WAND AND NOT THE HANDHELD. OLD PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE AND NO ANOMALY WAS FOUND. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE WAND AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS CONFIRMED. THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, WHICH PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS, HAD AN INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR. A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED AND ALL COMMUNICATION ERRORS WAS CLEARED. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE FOUND WITH THE WAND. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1494798;1;"THIS ISSUE WAS REPORTED BY THE SITE WHEN IT WAS NOTICED THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY OF PT DEMOGRAPHICS ON A PT REPORT. THIS REPORT CONTAINED RESULTS AND DEMOGRAPHICS INFORMATION FROM TWO DIFFERENT PTS.

THIS UTILITY IDENTIFIES PT FILES THAT HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED. IT HAS BEEN RUN DAILY AT THE REPORTING SITE. NO OCCURRENCES OF THIS DEFECT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE JULY 11, 2009 AT THE REPORTING SITE. THIS UTILITY HAS BEEN RUN ON AVAILABLE CURRENT DATA AT ALL (B) (6) CLIENTS. THIS UTILITY WILL ALSO BE RUN ON ALL AVAILABLE BACKUPS THAT CLIENTS HAVE AVAILABLE TO VERIFY PURGED PT DATA. SUNQUEST DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE FIX TO THE CACHE COUNTER COMPONENT THAT WILL LOCK THE COUNTER ONCE IT HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY A PROCESS UNTIL IT COMPLETES INTERACTION WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS. TYPE OF EVALUATION PERFORMED METHOD: COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROGRAM CODE EVALUATED. NOTE: DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ROOT CAUSE, THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED LATE. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT PT DATA (DEMOGRAPHICS, ORDERS AND RESULTS) IN SUNQUEST ENCOMPASS MAY BE INCORRECTLY COMBINED WITH OTHER PTS. THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN A SYSTEM MIDDLEWARE ERROR, THAT IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE USER, OCCURS IN THE DATABASE DURING THE PT REGISTRATION PROCESS. PTS MUST BE REGISTERED USING MENU OPTION PTS, SUBOPTION REGISTRATION IN SUNQUEST ENCOMPASS FOR THE PROBLEM TO OCCUR. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT AN INTERNAL PT IDENTIFICATION INDEX IS BEING ASSIGNED TO MULTIPLE PTS. THE ERRONEOUSLY COMBINED DATA IS DISPLAYED ON PT'S REPORTS AND INQUIRY; HOWEVER, THE PHYSICIAN ACTION CENTER, A FUNCTION WITHIN ENCOMPASS, DISPLAYS THE CORRECT RESULTS - ""NEW AND REPORTS - NEW""."
1494925;0;"(B) (4). (B) (4). EVAL SUMMARY: THE ANALYSIS RESULTS FOUND THAT THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DISTAL TIP OF THE BLADE BROKEN OFF AND PRESENT. THE REMAINING BLADE PORTION WAS SCRATCHED. THIS BLADE TIP PORTION MAY HAVE BROKEN OFF OF THE DEVICE DURING TRANSPORT TO OUR DECONTAMINATION FACILITY OR FROM OUR DECONTAMINATION TO THE ANALYSIS SITE. THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS ""ACTIVATION ISSUES"", ""DAMAGED BLADE"", AND ""JAWS WOULD NOT OPEN OR CLOSE"". THE CLAMP FUNCTION AS INTENDED, OPENED AND CLOSED PROPERLY. THE DEVICE WILL STOP ACTIVATING, AND EITHER EMI A SOLID TONE OR DISPLAY AN INSTRUMENT ERROR CODE 5 ON THE GENERATOR DISPLAY WHEN THE BLADE BECOMES DAMAGED. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THIS TYPE OF BLADE DAMAGE ARE EXTERNAL CONTACT DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE SUCH AS ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH METAL OR PLASTIC INSTRUMENTS OR OBJECTS WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS ACTIVATED. CONTACT WITH STAPLES, CLIPS, OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WHILE THE INSTRUMENT IS ACTIVATED MAY RESULT IN CRACKED OR BROKEN BLADES, WHICH MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY GENERATOR SOLID TONE OR INSTRUMENT ERROR. EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT, AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT THIS PROCESS. THE BATCH HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED DURING THE MFG PROCESS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING AN UNK PROCEDURE, THE DEVICE STOPPED WORKING AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE. THE SHEARS WERE DIFFICULT TO BE CLOSED. THE BLADE GOT DAMAGED AS WELL. NO ADVERSE PT CONSEQUENCES."
1495222;0;"IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION THAT A POLYFLEX STENT WAS USED DURING AN AIRWAY STENT PLACEMENT PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2009, (AGE REPORTED AS 18+). ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINANT, THE STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT THE CARINA. HOWEVER, THE STENT WAS CRIMPED AND DID NOT FULLY EXPAND AT THE DISTAL END. THE PT'S ANATOMY INFLUENCED THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE STENT BECAUSE THE ANATOMY WAS OVAL SHAPED INSTEAD OF ROUND. THE STENT WAS REPOSITIONED BY PULLING IT APPROX 2 CM PROXIMALLY. FOLLOWING 15 MINS POST STENT PLACEMENT, THE STENT STILL HAD NOT FULLY EXPANDED. THE PHYSICIAN MADE THE DECISION TO REMOVE THE STENT FROM THE PT AND ABORT THE PROCEDURE. TO DATE, THE PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN RESCHEDULED. THERE WERE NO PT COMPLICATIONS REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. THE PT'S CONDITION AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEDURE WAS REPORTED TO BE SATISFACTORY. (B)(4). THE COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFO, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. (B)(4)."
1495347;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE WAS NOT ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH PT'S GENERATORS. A COMPANY REP CONDUCTED TROUBLESHOOTING WHICH FOUND THAT AN ISSUE WITH THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS. THE WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS, WHICH CONFIRMED THAT COMMUNICATION ERRORS, AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE DUE TO INTERMITTENT CONDUCTORS IN THE SERIAL DATA CABLE THAT TRAVELS FROM THE WAND TO THE HANDHELD COMPUTER. ONCE A KNOWN GOOD CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED, NO FURTHER ANOMALIES WITH THE PROGRAMMING WAND WERE IDENTIFIED, AND THE DEVICE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECS. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

CUSTOMER'S RETURNED FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR TRANSMITTER WAS OBSERVED WITH A CRACK / FRACTURE ON THE PLASTIC HOUSING NEAR THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT AND THERE IS A BROKEN ALIGNMENT PIN FROM THE TRANSMITTER WAS OBSERVED. AUTOMATED TEST WAS PERFORMED ON RETURNED TRANSMITTER WITH TRANSMITTER TEST FIXTURE (EQ 3527) AND POWER SUPPLY (EQ 1285-0524) AND KEITHLEY 236 SOURCE MEASURE UNIT (EQ 2625). ALL FAILED TEST(S) RESULTS WAS OBSERVED FOR THE RETURNED TRANSMITTER. REMEDIAL ACTION 2954323-04/14/2009-002-C WAS REPORTED (B) (4) ON 14 APR 2009. CUSTOMER'S RETURNED FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR TRANSMITTER WAS OBSERVED WITH A CRACK/FRACTURE ON THE PLASTIC HOUSING NEAR THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SOME FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR TRANSMITTERS COULD POTENTIALLY EXHIBIT A CRACK/FRACTURE ON THE PLASTIC HOUSING NEAR THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW MOISTURE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE TRANSMITTER'S INTERNAL ELECTRONICS, POTENTIALLY CAUSING THE TRANSMITTER AND THE RECEIVER TO LOSE CONNECTION INTERRUPTING THE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE RESULTS. ALTHOUGH UNLIKELY, MOISTURE ENTERING THE TRANSMITTER HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE INACCURATE RESULTS ONLY WITH THE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE READINGS. THE BUILT-IN FREESTYLE GLUCOSE METER IS NOT IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE AND THE USER CAN CONTINUE TO USE THE BUILT-IN METER. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH, SERIOUS INJURY OR MISTREATMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.

RETAIN SAMPLES FROM TEST STRIP LOT 0822524 HAVE BEEN TESTED AND ONE OF EIGHT RETAIN VIALS WAS CONFIRMED TO ALSO PRODUCE LOW RESULTS WITH CONTROL SOLUTION TESTING. FURTHER OBSERVATION OBSERVED A SCRATCH IN THE CHANNEL OF THE CARBON SIDE OF THE STRIP. THE SCRATCH COMPLETELY SEVERS THE CHANNEL CAUSING AN ELECTRICAL ""OPEN"". THE LOCATION OF THE SCRATCH LEAVES HALF OF THE CARBON AREA TO CONDUCT CHARGE DURING THE REACTION, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A LOW READING. THESE ERRONEOUS RESULTS MAY OCCUR IN THE ""C"" ZONE OF THE PARKES ERROR GRID, AND AS SUCH, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. REMEDIAL ACTION 2954323-06/10/09-003-C WAS REPORTED (B) (4) ON 10 JUN 2009. NOTE: THE METER IS DESIGNED TO REPORT READINGS OF 20 MG/DL TO 500 MG/DL. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS METER DOES NOT GIVE A NUMERIC VALUE FOR READINGS LESS THAN 20 MG/DL. A READING LESS THAN 20 MG/DL WOULD DISPLAY A ""LO"" MESSAGE."

IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LAPAROSCOPIC SIGMOID PROCEDURE, THEY CONNECTED THE ANVIL TO THE STAPLER AND FELT THE TACTILE CLICK. WHILE CLOSING THE STAPLER DOWN, IT DISCONNECTED. THE ANVIL CAME COMPLETELY OFF THE STAPLER. A SECOND DEVICE WAS USED AND THEY ATTEMPTED TO FIND THE SAME OPENING AND COULD NOT. THEY HAD TO RESECT MORE TISSUE WITH A CONTOUR RELOAD FIRST, THEN THE SECOND DEVICE WORKED FINE. HOWEVER, WHEN THE LEAK TEST WAS PERFORMED THERE WAS A LEAK. A THIRD STAPLER WAS PULLED, THEY CONNECTED IT AND EVERYTHING SEEMED CORRECT BUT AS THEY DIALED IT DOWN, BUT IT SEEMED TO GET REALLY STIFF BEFORE IT WAS IN THE NORMAL FIRING RANGE. THE SURGEON WAS ABLE TO HOLD THE ANVIL CONNECTED TO THE STAPLER AND GUIDED IT DOWN SO THAT IT DID NOT POP OFF. PER THE SURGEON, THE STAPLES FROM THE SECOND STAPLER WERE FORMED PROPERLY. THE LEAK FOUND AFTER THE SECOND DEVICE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NOT TRANSECTING ENOUGH TISSUE AND TO TROCAR HOLES FROM THE FIRST STAPLER THAT PIERCED THROUGH THE TISSUE. THE PROCEDURE WAS EXTENDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL HALF HOUR. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE PATIENT.
1503987;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE WAS HAVING ISSUES WITH THE HANDHELD AND IT WOULD KEEP FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN.

GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD HANDHELD BACK TO MANUFACTURER HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.
1504000;1;THIS ISSUE WILL BE TEMPORARILY CORRECTED WITH A SOFTWARE PATCH (ALREADY AVAILABLE). TO PERMANENTLY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, NEW SOFTWARE, WILL BE RELEASED. THE NEW SOFTWARE WILL PERFORM A DETAILED VALIDATION OF EVERY SERIES THAT IS ARCHIVED. AFTER THE ZIP FILE IS CREATED THE NUMBER OF IMAGES, AND THE FILENAMES OF THE IMAGES WILL BE RECHECKED IN THE DATABASE AND IN THE ZIP FILE. THIS EVENT OCCURRED IN (B)(6). IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CUSTOMER'S ARCHIVED ZIP FILES DID NOT CONTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF IMAGES AS LISTED IN THE (B)(4) AND ARCHIVE DATABASE. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT NETWORK TRANSFER FAILURES MAY PREVENT A SERIES FROM BEING RECEIVED COMPLETELY. WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURS, THE SERIES IS RECEIVED WITH AN ERROR STATUS. HOWEVER, AUTO ARCHIVING OF THE RECEIVED SERIES WILL STILL BE ATTEMPTED AND AN ADDITIONAL TASK WILL BE ADDED. THIS ISSUE WAS CAUSED BY THE RACE CONDITION BETWEEN NETWORK SERVICE AND ARCHIVING SERVICE NOT BEING ALIGNED DURING NETWORK ERRORS. A CUSTOMER SAFETY ADVISORY NOTICE WILL BE INITIATED TO INFORM ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS. THIS EVENT OCCURRED IN (B)(6).
1504110;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LAPAROSCOPIC GASTRIC BYPASS PROCEDURE, UNKNOWN HOW MANY RELOADS. THE LAST FIRING OF THE CASE, THE DEVICE WOULD NOT OPEN. THE KNIFE WAS EXTENDED ALL THE WAY.

THERE WAS NO PATIENT CONSEQUENCE. (B) (4). (B) (4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT ONE EC60 DEVICE WAS RECEIVED WITH NO VISUAL NON-CONFORMANCES AND A CARTRIDGE RELOAD LOADED ON THE DEVICE. THE CARTRIDGE RELOAD WAS RECEIVED FULLY FIRED. THE DEVICE WAS TESTED FOR FUNCTIONALITY WITH A TEST CARTRIDGE RELOAD AND IT FIRED, CUT AND FORMED ALL STAPLES AS INTENDED. THE DEVICE OPENED AND CLOSED WITHOUT DIFFICULTIES. HOWEVER, THE FIRING TRIGGER DID NOT RETURN TO ITS HOME POSITION AFTER EACH STROKE. THE DEVICE WAS DISASSEMBLED TO EXAMINE THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS AND THE LEFT SIDE RELEASE BUTTON POST WAS BROKEN. ALTHOUGH THE RELEASE BUTTON IS NOT PART OF THE FIRING MECHANISM, WHEN IT BREAKS IT CREATES FRICTION TO THE FIRING MECHANISM RESULTING IN THE TRIGGER NOT PROPERLY RETURNING TO ITS HOME POSITION. ONE POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE MAY BE PARTIALLY ENGAGING THE ANVIL RELEASE BUTTON INADVERTENTLY WHILE CLOSING THE DEVICE BEFORE FIRING. THIS CAUSES THE RELEASE BUTTON TO PARTIALLY DISENGAGE FROM THE INDICATOR GEAR. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONDITION, WHEN THE DEVICE IS THEN FIRED, RESISTANCE WILL BE FELT AS THE RELEASE BUTTON BREAKS. AS PART OF OUR QUALITY PROCESS, EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED DURING MANUFACTURING TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVICE MEETS THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. THE BATCH RECORD WAS REVIEWED AND NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

THE CONSULTANT TESTED THE HANDHELD ON HIS DEMO GENERATOR AND THE EVENT WAS CONFIRMED. THE PROGRAMMING WAND, HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE WERE RETURNED FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. THE SOFTWARE AND PROGRAMMING WAND MET SPECIFICATIONS. THE CAUSE FOR THE HANDHELD NOT INTERROGATING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DAMAGED SERIAL CABLE. VISUAL ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED 4 BROKEN WIRE CONNECTIONS IN THE (B) (4) CONNECTOR PLUG ASSEMBLY. ONCE THE WIRES WERE RESOLDERED ONTO CORRECT LOCATIONS OF THE (B) (4) CONNECTOR PLUG PCB, THE SERIAL CABLE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND WAND. ALTHOUGH A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE WIRE BREAKS ARE UNKNOWN, THEY ARE MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISHANDLING OF THE SERIAL CABLE. NO FURTHER ANOMALIES ON THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. CONCLUSIONS: DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1513083;1;IT WAS REPORTED TO THE MANUFACTURER THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD NO LONGER HOLD CHARGE AND THE SCREEN FROZE INTERMITTENTLY DURING USE. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE NON-WORKING DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD IDENTIFIED A BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION NEAR THE MAIN BATTERY TERMINAL. THE CONDITION CAUSED THE HANDHELD TO INTERMITTENTLY LOSE POWER WHILE OPERATING ON MAIN BATTERY POWER. THIS ALSO PREVENTED RELIABLE CHARGING OF THE MAIN BATTERY. ONCE CONNECTION WAS RESOLDERED, FULL PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY WAS RESTORED.

1516741;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT DURING A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PATIENT'S OFF-TIME WAS SET TO 60 MINUTES OFF INSTEAD OF 3 MINUTES OFF. IT WAS SAID THAT THE PATIENT WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN HER SEIZURE LEVEL, BUT IT WAS STILL BELOW HER PRE-VNS BASELINE LEVELS, WHICH THE PHYSICIAN HAD ATTRIBUTED TO THE CHANGE IN SETTINGS. REVIEW OF THE PROGRAMMING HISTORY FROM THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER RESULTED IN AN INTERRUPTION IN A SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS, WHICH DIDN'T RESET HER SETTINGS. THERE WERE THREE MORE SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS PERFORMED, WHICH INDICATE WERE SUCCESSFUL, BUT IT IS LIKELY THAT ON THE THIRD DIAGNOSTIC TEST, HER SETTINGS WERE RESET AT THAT TIME DUE TO A POSSIBLE INTERRUPTION. THE PHYSICIAN THEN PERFORMED A NORMAL MODE DIAGNOSTIC TEST, WHICH SHOWED THAT THE OUTPUT CURRENT HAD THEN BEEN CHANGED TO 1.0MA. THE PHYSICIAN THEN PERFORMED AN INTERROGATION FOLLOWING THIS FINAL DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND CHANGED HER SETTINGS BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SETTINGS, EXCEPT HER OFF TIME DURING NORMAL MODE AND ON TIME DURING MAGNET MODE WERE ADVERTENTLY NOT CHANGED. THE PATIENT'S SETTINGS HAVE SINCE BEEN CORRECTED. THE DIAGNOSTICS RESULTS FOR THIS PATIENT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED IN REPORT #1644487-2009-02237.

I DON'T BLAME THE DOCTOR, BUT I AM INTERESTED IN WHAT ALTERNATIVES I HAVE AT THIS TIME. TO BE FAIR, I HAD RADIAL KERATOTOMY IN 1983 AND THAT GIVE ME GOOD VISION UNTIL RECENTLY. IT DID LEAVE SCARS ON THE CORNEA, WHICH WAS TO BE EXPECTED. BUT, THE SCARS APPARENTLY KEPT MY LATER SURGERY FROM BEING SUCCESSFUL. THE ""GAME PLAN"" WAS TO REPLACE MY ORIGINAL LENS -WHICH WAS NOT DISEASED- WITH A LENS THAT WOULD GIVE ME A WIDE RANGE OF VISION -NEAR, INTERMEDIATE, AND FAR-. THE REPLACEMENT LENS WAS TO BE AUGMENTED WITH LASIK SURGERY TO FINE-TUNE MY VISION. I HAD ONE LENS IMPLANTED. WHEN IT DIDN'T CORRECT MY VISION. THE DOCTOR REMOVED IT AND REPLACE IT WITH THE REZOOM. IT DIDN'T CORRECT MY VISION, EITHER. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED THAT CORNEAL SURGERY SHOULD BENEFIT ME, BUT IT REQUIRED ""TOPOGRAPHICAL CORNEAL MAPPING. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PROCEDURE WAS NOT APPROVED BY FDA. HE SAID THAT WHEN IT WAS APPROVED, IT WOULD BE ON A VERY LIMITED BASIS. MY QUESTION IS, IF THE ORIGINAL RADIAL KERATOTOMY CORNEAL SCARS ARE THE CAUSE OF MY INABILITY TO GET CORRECTIVE VISION WITH THE MULTIFOCAL LENS AUGMENTED WITH WAVE FRONT CORNEAL MAPPING, WOULD LASIK SURGERY AUGMENTED WITH TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPPING BE THE ANSWER?

IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE 3.50 X 16 MM LIBERTE STENT WOULD NOT CROSS THE LESION. THE 90% STENOSED LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE SEVERELY TORTUOUS AND CALCIFIED RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH AN UNK BALLOON. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A DIFFERENT DEVICE. NO PT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. PT'S STATUS REPORTED AS ""GOOD"". HOWEVER, THE RETURNED PRODUCT REVEALED STENT DAMAGE AND THE STENT MOVED ON THE BALLOON. A VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE FOUND THAT THE STENT WAS PULLED DISTALLY, WHICH RESULTED IN THE STENT BUNCHING APPROX 2 MM PROXIMAL TO THE DISTAL EDGE OF THE STENT. THE DISTAL END OF THE STENT WAS POSITIONED DISTAL TO THE DISTAL MARKERBAND. THE PROXIMAL EDGE OF THE STENT WAS APPROX 6 MM DISTAL TO THE DISTAL EDGE OF THE PROXIMAL MARKERBAND. THE BALLOON DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANY POSITIVE PRESSURES. THE MFG BATCH RECORD REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE MET ALL MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY, AND PERFORMANCE SPECS. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AS DEVICE PERFORMANCE WAS LIMITED DUE TO ANATOMICAL /PROCEDURAL FACTORS. (B)(4)."
1519611;0;IN 2009, INITIAL SURGERY WAS DONE WITH CHS PLATE SYSTEM FOR TROCHANTERIC FRACTURE. FOUR HOLE PLATE WAS USED. NO BONE SUBSTITUTE WAS USED. DURING THE SURGERY, THE LAG SCREW WAS NOT INSERTED DEEPLY ENOUGH. THE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT WAS BECAUSE THE PT'S BONE QUANTITY WAS NOT ENOUGH AND THE FRACTURED BONE WAS COMMUTED. AT ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER, IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL SCREWS WERE BACKED OUT AND THE PLATE WAS NOT FIXED. THE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT TOO MUCH LOAD WAS APPLIED TO THE SCREWS BECAUSE THE FRACTURED BONE WAS NOT UNITED. TWO MONTHS LATER, ANOTHER SURGERY WAS DONE TO REPLACE ALL THE IMPLANTS. BONE PASTE WAS USED TO ENHANCE THE FIXATION OF THE LAGS SCREW. BONE SUBSTITUTE WAS ALSO USED FOR THE FRACTURED PART OF TROCHANTER. THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEPUY WILL NOTIFY THE FDA OF THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION ONCE IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. (B)(4). THE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS WERE DUE TO THE ARCHITECT REACTION VESSELS (RVS) SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED RV LOTS MADE FROM A PARTICULAR POLYPROPYLENE RESIN LOT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE STATIC DISCHARGE EVENTS. ANALYSIS OF THIS RESIN LOT DETERMINED IT HAS UNIQUE COMPOSITIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER RESIN LOTS, WHICH FACILITATED THE BUILD-UP OF STATIC CHARGE ON THE RVS. THE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION ALSO IDENTIFIED VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS' MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO STATIC CHARGE VARIATION ACROSS RV LOTS. THE LATEST INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL VARIABLES WITHIN THE SUPPLIERS MOLDING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ABBOTT HAS IMPLEMENTED MORE STRINGENT STATIC CHARGE SAMPLING AND TESTING FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL INCOMING RV LOTS FROM OUR SUPPLIER. ABBOTT HAS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY OF INCOMING RESIN MATERIAL, AND TO IMPROVE THE SUPPLIER'S MOLDING PROCESS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL GENERATION OF STATIC CHARGE.

1544220;1;"A THIRD PARTY (NON AYCAN) DICOM-MODALITY-WORKLIST-SERVER SOLUTION, DESIGNED TO GENERATE STUDY-INSTANCE-UID'S IN CONNECTION WITH PT DATA FOR VARIOUS MODALITIES WAS REINSTALLED BY A THIRD PARTY COMPANY AT ONE OF AYCAN'S CUSTOMER LOCATIONS. AFTER A SYSTEM MANIPULATION BY A TECHNICIAN OF THIS THIRD PARTY COMPANY, THE SYSTEM ABOVE STARTED TO ALLOCATE STUDY-INSTANCE-UID'S, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED FOR PRIOR PT DATA INFO. THIS MALFUNCTION CAUSED THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE IMAGE DATA SETS WITH NOT UNIQUE STUDY INSTANCE UIDS. THESE INCORRECT DATA SETS WERE SENT, FOR DIAGNOSIS, TO AYCAN'S WORKSTATION OSIRIX PRO AND OTHER WORKSTATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THIS THIRD PARTY COMPANY'S SYSTEM MALFUNCTION INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED IMAGE DATA WAS DISPLAYED WITH INCORRECT PT DATA. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM NO PT OR OTHERS WERE HARMED IN ANY WAY. BECAUSE THE ABOVE DESCRIBED OCCURRENCE IS NOT CAUSED BY OUR SYSTEM, WE BELIEVE THIS MIGHT NOT BE AN OCCURRENCE ACCORDING 21 CFR 803. BUT BECAUSE THIS MALFUNCTION OF THIS THIRD PARTY SOLUTION IS CAUSING OUR SYSTEM TO DISPLAY INCORRECT INFO WE DECIDED TO REPORT THIS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF MISDIAGNOSIS. AS THIS ISSUE ONLY HAPPENS IN COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS WE SEE THE RISK OF REOCCURRENCE TO BE MARGINAL. CONFIG MISTAKE OF THIRD PARTY COMPANY'S TECH.

1546812;0;EVAL: WE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE REPORT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WAS NOT RETURNED TO COOK ENDOSCOPY FOR EVAL. WE COULD NOT CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD OR CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THIS LOT BECAUSE THE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT PROVIDED. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNT ORDERING AND SHIPPING HISTORY, THE LOT NUMBER COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. A REVIEW OF THE 12 MONTHS COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS REMOTE. CONCLUSIONS: WE COULD NOT CONDUCT A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVAL. A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED OBSERVATION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. HEMORRHAGE IS LISTED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AS A POTENTIAL COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR THIS DEVICE ADVISE THE USER TO ADVANCE THE FORCEPS INTO THE TISSUE AT THE DESIRED BIOPSY SITE. THEN THE USER IS INSTRUCTED TO CLOSE THE FORCEPS AROUND THE TISSUE WHILE USING SLIGHT PRESSURE ON THE HANDLE. THE USER IS INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN GENTLE HANDLE PRESSURE TO KEEP THE CUPS CLOSED AND GENTLY WITHDRAW THE FORCEPS FROM THE SITE. THE SIZE OF TISSUE SAMPLE OR BIOPSY TO BE EXCISED CAN BE CONTROLLED BY HOW THE USER HANDLES THE FORCEPS. IF EXCESSIVE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED DURING ADVANCEMENT INTO THE TISSUE OR DURING HANDLE MANIPULATION, THIS COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED OCCURRENCE. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL CAPTURA SERRATED FORCEPS WITH SPIKE ARE SUBJECT TO A VISUAL INSPECTION AND FUNCTIONAL TEST TO ENSURE PROPER WORKABILITY. CORRECTIVE ACTION: NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WARRANTED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THIS REPORT COULD NOT BE VERIFIED. THE COMPLAINT RISK PRIORITY NUMBER (CRPN) FOR THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTCOME. BASED ON THIS REPORT, NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS REMOTE. CUSTOMER QA WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS. DURING A COLONOSCOPY, THE PHYSICIAN USED A COOK ENDOSCOPY CAPTURA SERRATED FORCEPS WITH SPIKE. THE PHYSICIAN COMMENTED THE FORCEPS TOOK A LARGER BITE THAN EXPECTED, RESULTING IN INCREASED BLEEDING. A CLIP WAS APPLIED TO THE BIOPSY SITE. A FOREIGN OBJECT DID NOT HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED FROM THE PT. NO ADD'L MEDICAL PROCEDURES WERE REQUIRED DUE TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE PT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS DUE TO THIS OBSERVATION.
1546836;0;PROCEDURE: L. ANT. RESECTION W/END-END ANASTOMOSIS. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT: WHEN THE STAPLER WAS USED, THE ANVIL WAS INSERTED TO THE DISTAL SIGMOID. THE EEA STAPLER WAS INSERTED INTO THE ANAL CANAL, FOLLOWED BY THE ANASTOMOSIS ANVIL, THEN THE STAPLER AND KNOB ROTATED UNTIL GREEN INDICATOR APPEARED. A SOUND WAS HEARD BEFORE FIRING. WHEN IT WAS CHECKED AGAIN, THE ANVIL WAS TILTED. THE ANVIL TILTED PRIOR TO FIRING THE DEVICE. THE TISSUE WAS RELEASED FROM THE STAPLER. THE SURGEON OPENED THE PURSTRING FROM THE TILTED ANVIL, AND THEN CHANGED TO A NEW DEVICE. THE PROCEDURE DID EXTEND MORE THAN 30 MINUTES, AS THE SURGEON HAD TO REPEAT THE PROCEDURE FOR STAPLING AGAIN. NO DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED WITH STAPLE FORMATION OR TISSUE TRANSECTION, AND THERE WAS NO BLOOD LOSS OR UNANTICIPATED TISSUE DAMAGE.

NO FURTHER ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED AND THE SITE DID NOT ELECT TO RETURN THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER. THE SCREEN FREEZE IS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT IS RESOLVED WITH A SOFT OR HARD RESET."
1547244;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S POWER CORD ON THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT STAYING PLUGGED INTO THE WALL OUTLET. A NEW HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS. PRODUCT ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD COMPUTER, WHICH DID NOT CONFIRM THE REPORTED POWER CORD ISSUE. DURING THE ANALYSIS, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE MAIN BATTERY WAS NOT BEING CHARGED BY THE HANDHELD. THE CAUSE FOR THE ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTIONS ON THE HANDHELD MAIN BOARD. AFTER THE BROKEN CONNECTIONS WERE RESOLDERED TO THE MAIN BOARD, NO FURTHER ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. ANALYSIS OF THE FLASHCARD/SOFTWARE RESULTED IN NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.
1547765;1;THE ISSUE INVOLVES CERNER MILLENNIUM I&O2G AND AFFECTS USERS THAT UTILIZE THE INTAKE AND OUTPUT SECOND GENERATION TO RECORD A PT'S FLUID INTAKE AND OUTPUT FOR AN SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. IN CERNER MILLENNIUM, WHEN THE USER INITIALLY LOADS OR REFRESHES THE VIEW IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER I&O RESULTS DO NOT DISPLAY IN THE TIME COLUMN DIRECTLY AFTER THE SHIFT TOTAL COLUMN. PT CARE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS CLINICIAN'S FINDINGS MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE. THIS ISSUE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY AS CLINICAL DECISIONS COULD BE BASED ON INCOMPLETE DATA. CERNER HAS NOT RECEIVED COMMUNICATION ON ANY ADVERSE PT EVENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE.

AT THIS CUSTOMER'S REQUEST, THE CS WENT INTO THE DATABASE SERVER (DBS) CONFIGURATION TO CHANGE THE UNIT NAME FOR A DEVICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY, STAFF INFORMED PHILIPS THAT THIS SAVED DATA WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO DOCUMENT IN THE PT'S RECORD. WHEN THE CS ENTERED THE DBS CONFIGURATION AND CHANGED THE UNIT NAME, EXISTING SAVED HISTORY IN THE TRANSFER LIST WAS LOST. NO DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED, AND THERE IS NO ALLEGATION THAT THE DEVICE WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATH. CHANGES MADE IN CONFIGURATION MODE TO SOME SETTINGS CAN LEAD TO A LOSS OF SAVED DATA DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE DATABASE. THE CUSTOMER WAS INFORMED OF THIS OCCURRENCE. THIS DATA LOSS IS NOT A HEALTH RISK BECAUSE IT DOES NO IMPACT REAL-TIME MONITORING. NO FURTHER ACTION OR INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.

THE TIP SECTION OF THE DEVICE WAS DAMAGED. THE PROXIMAL END OF THE BALLOON WAS SLIGHTLY INFLATED. A 0.015 INCH PRODUCT MANDREL WAS INSERTED THROUGH THE LUMEN WITH NO RESTRICTIONS NOTED. THE MFG RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND NO ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND AND MET ALL SPECS. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AS DEVICE PERFORMANCE WAS LIMITED DUE TO ANATOMICAL PROCEDURAL FACTORS. (B)(4)."
1552004;0;"A CUSTOMER INITIALLY REPORTED A CONNECTIVITY ISSUE WITH THEIR FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR CGMS. THE SYSTEM WAS RETURNED AND UPON PRODUCT INVESTIGATION, A CRACK WAS OBSERVED ON THE LOWER HOUSING NEAR THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT OF THE TRANSMITTER. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SOME FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR TRANSMITTERS COULD POTENTIALLY EXHIBIT A CRACK/FRACTURE ON THE PLASTIC HOUSING NEAR THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW MOISTURE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE TRANSMITTER'S INTERNAL ELECTRONICS, POTENTIALLY CAUSING THE TRANSMITTER AND THE RECEIVER TO LOSE CONNECTION INTERRUPTING THE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE RESULTS. ALTHOUGH UNLIKELY, MOISTURE ENTERING THE TRANSMITTER HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE INACCURATE RESULTS ONLY WITH THE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE READINGS. THE BUILT-IN FREESTYLE GLUCOSE METER IS NOT IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE AND THE USER CAN CONTINUE TO USE THE BUILT-IN METER. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF DEATH, SERIOUS INJURY OR MISTREATMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. (B) (4).  RETURNED TRANSMITTER WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND CONFIRMED TO HAVE CRACKS IN THE BATTERY AREA.  LEAK TESTING WAS ALSO PERFORMED. THE RETURNED TRANSMITTER PASSED LEAK TESTING.   BASED ON THESE RESULTS, THIS ISSUE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIAL ACTION 2954323-04/14/2009-002-C. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD A CARDIAC ARREST IN 2009 AND CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) WAS GIVEN. AN AED WAS USED BUT ADVISED NOT TO SHOCK THE PATIENT. WHEN THE PATIENT ARRIVED AT THE EMERGENCY UNIT, ASYSTOLE WAS DETERMINED. AN ER CONSULTANT STATED ""THE RHYTHM SEEMED TO BE ASYSTOLE FROM THE START"". THE PATIENT EXPIRED. DEVICE HISTORY REPORTS DID NOT REGISTER ANY TACHYARRYTHMIA EPISODES FOR THAT DAY. IT WAS REPORTED THE PATIENT HAD SUFFERED FREQUENT SIMILAR TYPES OF EPISODES SINCE TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO EVENT. A CONSULTANT IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE STATED THAT A TECHNICAL CHECK OF THE DEVICE SUGGESTS A POSSIBLE FAULT. THIS IS AN INITIAL REPORT. THE CUSTOMER'S PRODUCT DID NOT CONFIRM THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUE. THE FREESTYLE NAVIGATOR TRANSMITTER WAS SENT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SENT ONCE INVESTIGATION RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE. REMEDIAL ACTION 2954323-04/14/2009-002-C WAS REPORTED (B) (4) ON 14 APR 2009."
1552751;0;THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEPUY WILL NOTIFY THE FDA OF THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION ONCE IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE PATIENT WAS REVISED BECAUSE OF INFECTION.

1553351;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT A VNS (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FROZEN ON THE INTERROGATION SCREEN. AFTER LETTING THE COMPUTER FULLY CHARGE, THE SCREEN FREEZING RESOLVED AND THE COMPUTER PERFORMED AS INTENDED. THE COMPUTER WILL NOT BE RETURNED.
1553352;1;DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD SCREEN WAS BLANK. THE SCREEN HAD A BLUE LINE GOING DOWN THE LEFT SIDE AND SOFT/HARD RESETS AND TAKING OUT OF THE BATTERY DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE POWER LIGHT WOULD TURN ON, HOWEVER, THE SCREEN WOULD REMAIN BLANK. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD DEVICE AND HIS OLD HANDHELD DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. THERE WERE NO ANOMALIES FOUND WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE SCREEN WAS DEFECTIVE WHICH CAUSED THE SCREEN TO BE BLANK. ONCE THE SCREEN WAS REPLACED WITH A KNOWN GOOD SCREEN, THE ISSUE RESOLVED.
1553403;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN WAS HAVING ISSUES WITH HER HANDHELD DEVICE. THE HANDHELD SCREEN WOULD FREEZE DURING INTERROGATIONS AND THE PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM A SOFT RESET IN ORDER TO GET THE SCREEN TO MOVE. A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PHYSICIAN'S OLD HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE WERE RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS. DURING ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD AND SOFTWARE, THE FROZEN SCREEN WAS DUPLICATED AND IS DUE TO A SOFTWARE ERROR. OTHER THAN THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUE, NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT DEVICE PERFORMANCE.
1553407;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE PT'S MAGNET ACTIVATIONS WERE NOT REGISTERING ON THE HANDHELD COMPUTER AND OLD ACTIVATIONS WERE MISSING FROM THE HISTORY. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFO HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1553427;0;REPORTER ALLEGED OBTAINING A DISCREPANT BLOOD GLUCOSE RESULT OF 149 MG/DL BACK TO BACK WITH A RESULT OF 504 MG/DL ON AVIVA SYSTEM WHEN TESTING WAS PERFORMED WITHIN 10 MINS. NO ACTIONS WERE REPORTED TAKEN OR TREATMENT RECEIVED. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR THE RETURN OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT.
1553531;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT HE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS INTERROGATING PATIENT'S GENERATOR IN THE OR DURING AN INITIAL IMPLANT. IT INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICIAN HAD REPLACED THE WAND BATTERY A NIGHT BEFORE AND THE HANDHELD (HHD) WAS FULLY CHARGED. HHD WAS UNPLUGGED FROM THE WALL AND THE COMPANY REP WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATION BY HOLDING IN THE SERIAL CABLE AT THE BASE OF THE WAND. NEW WAND WAS REQUESTED BY THE SITE. NEW WAND WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD WAND WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE WAND AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS CONFIRMED. THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, WHICH PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS, HAD AN OPEN CONDUCTOR. A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED AND ALL COMMUNICATIONS ERRORS CLEARED. NO OTHER ANOMALY WAS OBSERVED WITH THE WAND. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1553534;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEY HAD THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER PLUGGED IN FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK AND WHEN THEY WOULD UNPLUG IT AND USE IT, THE SCREEN WENT BLANK. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO HAVE THE HANDHELD RETURNED FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1553548;0;REPORTER ALLEGED THAT SHE BECAME INCOHERENT AND UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE, SO THE PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED. REPORTER STATED A RESULT OF 58 MG/DL WAS OBTAINED ON HER AVIVA SYSTEM AND WITHIN 10 MINUTES, THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED AND OBTAINED A RESULT OF 32 MG/DL ON THEIR SYSTEM. REPORTER WAS TREATED WITH A PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH AND THEN A RESULT OF 525 MG/DL WAS OBTAINED ON HER AVIVA SYSTEM, WHICH WAS LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE LAST 32 MG/DL RESULT OBTAINED ON PARAMEDIC'S SYSTEM. NO OTHER ACTIONS WERE REPORTED TAKEN OR TREATMENT RECEIVED. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR THE RETURN OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT.
1553672;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING UPON INTERROGATION. THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED WITH SOFT AND HARD RESETS, BUT THE SITE WAS FRUSTRATED SO A REPLACEMENT WAS REQUESTED. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE DEVICE BACK FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1553676;1;DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN'S NURSE THAT HER HANDHELD FROZE ON THE HP SCREEN. THE NURSE TRIED TO PERFORM A SOFT RESET BUT STILL WOULD NOT WORK. SHE THEN PERFORMED A HARD RESET AND IT DID TURN ON BUT IT SHUT OFF. NURSE INDICATED THAT IT WAS NOT CHARGED. NEW HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND A BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION WAS IDENTIFIED ON THE HANDHELD MAIN BOARD. THE CAUSE OF REPORTED ALLEGATION COULD BE LIKELY DUE TO THE BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION. THE BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION PREVENTED THE MAIN BATTERY FROM MAKING GOOD ELECTRICAL CONTACT WITH PCB. THIS CONDITION CAUSED THE HHD TO INTERMITTENTLY LOSE POWER WHILE THE DEVICE IS OPERATING ON THE MAIN BATTERY POWER. NO FURTHER ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED. AN ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE FLASHCARD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OF DATABASE WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE FLASHCARD ANALYSIS.
1553980;0;COMPLAINANT ALLEGED THAT DURING A ROUTINE SHIFT CHECK BY A CLINICIAN, THE DEVICE WOULD NOT POWER UP. COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION. ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION HAS RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AND WILL BE PROVIDING A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WHEN OUR INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED.

1554628;0;THIS IS A CASE REPORT RECEIVED FROM A PHARMACIST OF CHU MONTPELLIER. IT IS REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2009, A BAXTER CRYOCYTE FREEZING BAG RUPTURED AT THE LEVELS OF THE SEAL. IT IS REPORTED THAT IT WAS DECIDED BY THE DOCTOR TO NOT USE THIS BAG AND THAT THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT BE INJECTED TO THE PATIENT. THERE WERE NO CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES REPORTED FOR THE PATIENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON NOVEMBER 30TH 2009: THIS ISSUE WAS OBSERVED DURING THE THAWING STEP. THERE WERE NO CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PATIENT BECAUSE A SECOND CRYOCYTE BAG WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE GRAFT. (B)(4). BAXTER MEDICAL ASSESSMENT: THIS IS A CRYOCYTE BAG BREAKAGE THAT WAS DISCOVERED. THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED NEGATIVE CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES. AS IN ALL CASES OF CRYOCYTE BAG BREAKAGES DURING STORAGE, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OF LOSS OF ENGRAFTMENT OR DELAY IN ENGRAFTMENT WITH THE LOSS OF PRODUCT. THIS PUTS THE PATIENT AT GREATER RISK. AS SUCH, A BREAKAGE COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN EVENT IF IT WERE TO REOCCUR. (B)(6). UPON COMPLETION OF THE SAMPLE EVALUATION, A FOLLOW-UP SUBMISSION WILL BE SUBMITTED.
1555537;0;THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED REFLECTS ALL RELEVANT DATA RECEIVED. IF ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION IS RECEIVED, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. EVALUATION SUMMARY: ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE REVEALED NORMAL BATTERY DEPLETION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS LOSS OF OUTPUT AND THAT THE DEVICE WAS AT EOL (END OF LIFE). THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED AND REPLACED. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.

1555872;1;IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT AN OUTBOUND PHLEBOTOMY POINT OF CARE (POC) INTERFACE IS COMBINING PT ORDERS INAPPROPRIATELY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: WHEN THE FIRST ORDER ALPHABETICALLY IN THE BATTERY OF TESTS DOES NOT QUALIFY TO CROSS THE POC INTERFACE, SUCH AS BILL ONLY TEST, BATCH MODE MUST BE TURNED OFF ON THE PHLEBOTOMY POC INTERFACE, NOTE: THIS IS A HARD CODED FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS. THERE MUST BE MULTIPLE PATIENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR THE DOWNLOAD TO THE OUTBOUND POC ENTRY INTERFACE. NOTE: THERE ARE A TOTAL OF NINE (9) SITES POTENTIALLY AFFECTED. SUNQUEST HAS DISCONTINUED INSTALLING THE PHLEBOTOMY POC INTERFACE AND NO FURTHER CLIENTS CAN BE AFFECTED. THIS ISSUE WAS REPORTED BY THE SITE WHEN IT WAS NOTICED THE POC PHLEBOTOMY SPECIMEN LABEL CONTAINED PT DEMOGRAPHIC INFO FROM ONE PT AND SUNQUEST DISPLAYED PT DEMOGRAPHIC INFO FROM ANOTHER PT. IF THE TECHNOLOGIST PROCEEDS TO PROCESS AND ACCEPT THE RESULTS THAT CONTAIN MISMATCHED PT DEMOGRAPHICS, INCORRECT RESULTS WOULD APPEAR ON A PT REPORT OR INQUIRY. SUNQUEST APPLICATION INTERFACING HAS CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AND WILL BE CONTACTING EACH AFFECTED FACILITY (9 TOTAL) TO SCHEDULE INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE CORRECTION. EXAMPLE PRECONDITIONS: PT A HAS THE FOLLOWING ORDER IN SUNQUEST M123: CBC. PT B HAS THE FOLLOWING ORDERS IN SUNQUEST M456: BILL, LYTES. THE POINT OF CARE (POC) INTERFACE MAY INAPPROPRIATELY COMBINE THE ORDERS FOR PATIENTS A AND B, SENDING ONLY PT B WITH THE COMBINED ORDERS IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT: PT B: M123: CBC, M456: LYTES. NOTE: ACCESSION M456 CONTAINS A BILL ONLY TEST WHOSE TEST CODE IS ALPHABETICALLY FIRST IN THE LIST OF ORDERS. HOWEVER, THE BILL ONLY TEST DOES NOT QUALIFY TO DOWNLOAD TO THE POC DEVICE. PT A'S ORDER (CBC) IS NOT SENT ACROSS THE PHLEBOTOMY POC INTERFACE AND REMAINS UNCHANGED IN SUNQUEST. PHLEBOTOMIST COLLECTS THE SPECIMENS USING THE POC LABELS FOR PT B. PHLEBOTOMIST UPLOADS THE COLLECT DATE/TIME MODIFICATIONS BACK TO SUNQUEST FOR PT B. NOTE: A MESSAGE (2051) IS WRITTEN TO THE POC INBOUND INTERFACE ERROR LOG INDICATING THE COLLECT DATE/TIME HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED FOR PT B. IN SUNQUEST, PT B HAD NO CBC ON FILE FOR ACCESSION NUMBER M123. THE TECHNOLOGIST PERFORMS THE TESTING ON THE CBC ON PT B. RESULTING APPLICATIONS WILL DISPLAY THE PT DEMOGRAPHICS FOR PT A AND NOT PT B WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AUTOFILING. NOTE: IF THE CBC RESULTS ARE ACCEPTED, THE RESULTS ARE FILED TO PT A. NOTE: SPECIMEN RECEIPT APPLICATIONS, ORDER RECEIPT MODIFICATION (ORM) OR COLLECTION LIST VERIFY ((B)(4)), SHOULD BE USED TO CROSS-REFERENCE THE PT DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN THE POC CONTAINER LABEL AND SUNQUEST PRIOR TO RESULTING. TYPE OF EVAL PERFORMED METHOD: COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROGRAM CORE EVALUATED.
1556295;0;DURING A COLONOSCOPY PROCEDURE THE PHYSICIAN SELECTED A COOK ENDOSCOPY ACUJECT VARIABLE INJECTION NEEDLE. THE NEEDLE WAS ADVANCED THROUGH THE ENDOSCOPE AND INTO POSITION. THE NEEDLE WOULD NOT EXIT THE DISTAL END OF THE OUTER CATHETER. THE NEEDLE WAS REMOVED FROM THE ENDOSCOPE. ANOTHER NEEDLE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. A FOREIGN OBJECT DID NOT HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED FROM THE PATIENT. NO ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PROCEDURES WERE REQUIRED, DUE TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE PATIENT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS DUE TO THIS OBSERVATION. EVALUATION: OUR EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE CONFIRMED THE REPORT OF NEEDLE EXTENSION DIFFICULTY. THE NEEDLE REMAINS INSIDE THE DISTAL END OF THE SHEATH AND WILL NOT EXTEND WITH HANDLE MANIPULATION. THE OUTER SHEATH IS SEVERELY KINKED APPROXIMATELY 77.3 CM FROM THE DISTAL END. THE KINK IN THE OUTER CATHETER IS PREVENTING MOVEMENT OF THE INNER CATHETER, RESULTING IN NEEDLE EXTENSION DIFFICULTY. THE KINK IN THE CATHETER IS LIKELY TO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO AN APPLICATION OF EXCESSIVE PRESSURE DURING USE AND/OR GENERAL HANDLING OF THE DEVICE. THE OUTER SHEATH MEASURES WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS. A PRODUCT DISCREPANCY OR ANOMALY THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OCCURRENCE WAS NOT OBSERVED DURING OUR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THE LOT NUMBER SAID TO BE INVOLVED, WE CAN REPORT NO DISCREPANCIES OR ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. WE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THIS LOT BECAUSE NONE OF THE PRODUCT FROM THIS LOT REMAINED IN FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY. A REVIEW OF TWELVE MONTH COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS RARE. CONCLUSIONS: A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THIS OBSERVATION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE ACTUAL USE CONDITIONS COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED IN THE LABORATORY SETTING. DUE TO A VARIETY OF CLINICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS PATIENT ANATOMY, ENDOSCOPE POSITION OR PROGRESSION OF DISEASE STATE, WE COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS OF PRODUCT USAGE DURING OUR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. THIS LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE A CAUSE. IF THE OUTER CATHETER BECOMES KINKED, THIS CAN CAUSE NEEDLE EXTENSION DIFFICULTY. KINKS CAN OCCUR IF THE PRODUCT EXPERIENCES EXCESSIVE PRESSURE DURING USE AND/OR GENERAL HANDLING. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ADVISE THE USER TO ADVANCE THE PRODUCT THROUGH THE ACCESSORY CHANNEL OF THE ENDOSCOPE IN SHORT INCREMENTS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL AID IN PRESERVATION OF THE PRODUCT. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL ACUJECT VARIABLE INJECTION NEEDLES ARE SUBJECTED TO A FUNCTIONAL TEST TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE NEEDLE EXTENSION. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD CONFIRMED THAT THIS LOT MET MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: THE REPORT OF NEEDLE EXTENSION DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF APPROPRIATE INTERNAL PERSONNEL. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY AS PART OF QUALITY REVIEW BOARD (QRB) ACTIVITIES. THE COMPLAINT RISK PRIORITY NUMBER (CRPN) FOR THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTCOME. BASED ON THIS ACTIVITY, NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OCCURRENCE IS RARE. CUSTOMER QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS.
1556337;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT NO INCREASE OF AUDITORY THRESHOLD WAS NOTED. AT MAXIMAL AMPLIFICATION, THE PT IS NOT ABLE TO HEAR WITH THE DEVICE. IF PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THE IMPLANT SITE, THE PT EXPERIENCES A SWOOSHING NOISE. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLANTED. IF IT SHOULD BE EXPLANTED, IT IS TO BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR EVAL. WHEN AVAILABLE, A DEVICE FAILURE ANALYSIS WILL BE SUBMITTED AS A F/U REPORT.
1556488;1;A FOLLOW-UP MDR WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED. (B)(4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTS THAT THE BROKER PREFETCH ENGINE SENT REJECTED IMAGES FROM THE ENTERPRISE ARCHIVE TO THE HOLOGIC MAMMO VIEWING WORKSTATION (THIRD PARTY DICOM DEVICE), SENDING 15 INSTEAD OF 11. FOUR OF THE 15 IMAGES THAT WERE SENT TO THE MAMMOGRAPHY DEVICE WERE FOR THE WRONG PATIENT. THE PHYSICIAN DID DETECT THIS. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT.
1556577;0;"THIS PT WAS OFFERED BRCA GENETIC TESTING BY HER OB/GYN BECAUSE HER PATERNAL FIRST COUSIN, WHO HAS BREAST CANCER, WAS FOUND TO HAVE A BRCA1 ""MUTATION"". THIS TURNS OUT TO BE NOT QUITE TRUE, BUT I FOUND THAT OUT LATER. WHEN SHE WAS FINALLY REFERRED TO ME, I FOUND THAT MANY MISTAKES HAD HAPPENED. FIRST, THE COUSIN DID NOT HAVE AN ACTUAL MUTATION, SHE HAD A ""VARIANT OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE; SUSPECTED DELETERIOUS"" IN THE BRCA1 GENE. IT IS LIKELY TO BE MUTATION, BUT NOT CERTAIN. WHEN THE DOCTOR TESTED THE PT, HE LATER REFERRED TO ME, HE SHOULD HAVE TESTED HER FOR THIS SPECIFIC VARIANT, WHICH IS THE STANDARD OF CARE. INSTEAD, HE TESTED HER USING COMPREHENSIVE SEQUENCING WHICH IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY, WHICH LOOKS FOR ALL MUTATIONS IN BOTH BRCA1 AND BRCA2. IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE KNOWN VARIANT/LIKELY MUTATION IN THE FAMILY BUT YET A DIFFERENT ""VARIANT OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE"" IN THE BRCA2 GENE. THIS ONE IS TRULY UNCERTAIN, NOT SUSPECTED DELETERIOUS. IT IS ALSO NOT IN THE SAME GENE; IT IS A COMPLETE COINCIDENCE AND UNRELATED TO HER COUSIN'S SITUATION. THE LABORATORY OFFERS TESTING TO BOTH PARENTS TO TRY TO SEE WHICH SIDE OF THE FAMILY IT COMES FROM, SO WITHOUT EVEN TELLING THE PT WHY, THE DOCTOR -ACCORDING TO THE PT- HAD HIS NURSE CALL HER AND SAY THAT BEFORE THEY COULD GIVE HER THE RESULTS, HER PARENTS NEEDED TO BE TESTED. THIS IS NOT STANDARD OF CARE, AS IT'S JUST AN OFFER, NOT A REQUIREMENT, AND BOTH PARENTS DON'T NEED TO BE TESTED. IF ONE HAS IT, THE OTHER WON'T. SHE WAS UPSET AND NO ONE WOULD GIVE HER THE RESULTS OR AN EXPLANATION OR A REFERRAL TO A GENETIC COUNSELOR. NO ONE EXPLAINED THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE HER COUSIN'S ""MUTATION"". ONCE THE RESULTS CAME BACK THAT HER FATHER HAD THE SAME VARIANT THAT SHE DID AND THE DOCTOR DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT ALL HE REFERRED HER TO ME, THE GENETIC COUNSELOR. HE KNOWS I'M AVAILABLE YET, DIDN'T REFER HER TO ME FROM THE BEGINNING. ONCE I HAD ALL THE INFO, INCLUDING HER ORIGINAL TEST REQUEST FORM FOR THE LAB, I EVEN DISCOVERED THAT WHOEVER FILLED OUT THE FORM HAD ALL HER FAMILY HISTORY INFO ON THE FORM INCORRECT. I DREW A PEDIGREE BASED ON THAT FORM AND WHEN THE PT CAME IN FOR COUNSELING, I CHECKED IT WITH HER AND SHE SAID EVERY ENTRY WAS WRONG. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE GOT EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS CASE AND THAT THE LABORATORY IS TELLING DOCTORS OFFICES THEY CAN DO THIS PROCESS WITHOUT GENETIC COUNSELORS BUT THEY'RE NOT TEACHING THEM HOW."

1569665;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT A NEUROLOGIST'S WAND WAS NOT WORKING AND NO FURTHER SPECIFICS WERE GIVEN AT THE TIME. FURTHER INFO WAS PROVIDED BY THE NEUROLOGIST'S NURSE INDICATING THE WAND WAS HAVING ISSUES INTERROGATING A DEMO GENERATOR AS THEY WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTERROGATE THE DEMO GENERATOR WITH ANOTHER WAND. ADDITIONAL INFO FROM THE NURSE REVEALED THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND WAND WAS CHECKED AND THE HANDHELD WAS UNPLUGGED FROM THE AC POWER SUPPLY, BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. FURTHERMORE, THE NURSE WAS NOT SURE IF THE BATTERY INSIDE THE WAND WAS REPLACED FOLLOWING THE TROUBLESHOOTING. A NEW WAND WAS SENT TO THE TREATING NEUROLOGIST AND GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD WAND TO THE MFR HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1569666;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN EPILEPTOLOGIST HAD TROUBLE INTERROGATING A RECENTLY IMPLANTED VNS PT USING HIS PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. THE EPILEPTOLOGIST DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE PT'S GENERATOR AS THE PT WAS JUST IMPLANTED IN (B) (6) 2009 AND COULD PALPATE THE PT'S GENERATOR RULING OUT IMPLANT DEPTH INTERFERENCE. FURTHERMORE, THE EPILEPTOLOGIST REPLACED THE 9V BATTERY ON THE WAND AND HAD THE HANDHELD UNPLUGGED FROM THE AC POWER SUPPLY BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. A NEW PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS SENT TO THE EPILEPTOLOGIST AND THE OLD PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR TO UNDERGO PRODUCT ANALYSIS. DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1569670;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTIES ESTABLISHING CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION WITH A PT'S GENERATOR. THE PT HAD BEEN RECENTLY HAD THE GENERATOR IMPLANTED AND THUS WAS NOT SUSPECTED AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED BUT THE ISSUES DID NOT RESOLVE. THE PHYSICIAN NOTED THAT HE COULD SEE SOME OF THE WIRES IN THE SERIAL ADAPTER CORD WHICH CONNECTS THE PROGRAMMING WAND TO THE PROGRAMMING HANDHELD COMPUTER. THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, WHICH FOUND THAT THERE WAS A WIRE WITHIN THE SERIAL ADAPTER CORD WHICH HAD BECOME DISCONNECTED FROM THE ADAPTER BOARD INSIDE THE CORD. ONCE THE WIRE WAS RE-ATTACHED, THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES RESOLVED, AND THERE WERE NO OTHER ANOMALIES IDENTIFIED. CONCLUSIONS - DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

1570346;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT A SURGEON'S (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FROZEN ON THE ""INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL"" SCREEN WHILE IN THE OPERATING ROOM FOR AN INITIAL IMPLANT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE SURGEON REVEALED THAT RE-SEATING THE FLASHCARD RESOLVED THE ISSUE. CURRENTLY A NEW HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE SURGEON AND THE OLD HANDHELD IS TO BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER."
1570347;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NEUROLOGIST'S PROGRAMMING WAND WAS NOT FUNCTIONING AS IT COULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH A PATIENT'S GENERATOR DURING INTERROGATION. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED ON THE PROGRAMMING WAND BY CHANGING THE 9 VOLT BATTERY BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. CONNECTIONS ON THE HANDHELD AND WAND WERE CHECKED AND IT WAS STATED THAT THE HANDHELD WAS CONNECTED TO THE AC POWER SUPPLY WHILE ATTEMPTING TO INTERROGATE THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR. AT THE MOMENT IT IS UNKNOWN IF ELECTRO-MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMUNICATION ISSUES AS THE PATIENT WAS NO LONGER PRESENT AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED.
1570351;1;IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEIR HANDHELD SCREEN HAS BEEN FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. HANDHELD WAS REBOOTED BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO PERSIST. THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND NO OBVIOUS ANOMALY WAS NOTICED. ANALYSIS ON THE FLASHCARD WAS COMPLETED AND THE SCREEN FREEZE EVENT WAS NOT DUPLICATED. THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. HOWEVER, MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER.
1570466;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NEUROLOGIST COULD NOT ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH TWO PT GENERATORS AS HE COULD NOT INTERROGATE THEM. INFO FROM THE SITE INDICATED THAT TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED AS TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMMING WAND'S BATTERY AND VERIFY THAT THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE AC POWER SUPPLY BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. FURTHERMORE, AFTER ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH A PT'S GENERATOR FOR 10-15 MINUTES, THE SITE WAS ABLE TO INTERROGATE THE PT. A NEW PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD PROGRAMMING SYSTEM HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1570469;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT HER HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINING 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE WAS FROZEN ON THE SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATION SCREEN. A SOFT RESET WAS PERFORMED WHICH RESOLVED THE PROBLEM AND HANDHELD COMPUTER WORKED PROPERLY. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. THIS IS A KNOWN EVENT WITH THE 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE.
1570477;1;"IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER HAD A ""FRAYED CORD,"" BUT NO DETAILS ARE KNOWN ABOUT THE CAUSE. THE DEVICE HAS NOT BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS."
1570563;1;PER THE TRANSFUSION GUIDELINES FOR BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICES IN THE (B) (4), THE SYSTEM TRANSLATES THIS EXP DATE AS 2 JAN 2001 INSTEAD OF THE EXPECTED 1 FEB 2001. THIS COULD RESULT IN PRODUCTS EXPIRING PREMATURELY OR AFTER THE CORRECT EXP DATE IN THE BLOOD BANK SYSTEM. NOTE: NO PT HARM HAS BEEN REPORTED. (B) (4). AFTER PERFORMING A COMPREHENSIVE RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF THE CODE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT IN BLOOD PRODUCT ENTRY (BPE) IF THE DATE FORMAT SITE PARAMETER IS SET TO 'AL' AND THE CODABAR BARCODE IS SCANNED AT THE EXP DATE PROMPT USING THE DD/MM/YYYY DATE FORMAT, THE EXPIRATION DATE MAY TRANSLATE INCORRECTLY WHERE THE MONTH AND DAY ARE REVERSED.

1570647;0;INFORMATION ANTICIPATED, BUT UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. IT WAS REPORTED POST OP AN ADJUSTABLE GASTRIC BAND PROCEDURE, A FLUOROSCOPY WAS PERFORMED AND NO LEAK WAS DETECTED. THE SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THE BAND ANYWAY. THE SURGEON MOVED THE STOMACH UP FROM AROUND THE BAND AND CUT THE BUCKLE. THEN HE PULLED THE BAND TUBING WITH GRASPERS AND REMOVED THE PORT. WHEN THE LOCKING CONNECTORS WERE UNLOCKED THE STRAIN RELIEF WAS GONE. THE STRAIN RELIEF WAS LEFT IN THE PATIENT. THE BAND WAS REPLACED. THE PROCEDURE WENT WELL AND THE PATIENT HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL.
1570801;1;THERE IS A DROP DOWN MENU FOR MEDICATION DOSING FREQUENCY WITH MORE THAN 225 OPTIONS THAT HAS AN INACCURATE AND ERROR PRONE OVERRIDE, REQUIRING SCROLLING THROUGH THE OPTIONS ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER OR COUNTERINTUITIVE TERMS. THIS PROMOTED ERRORS IN DOSING FREQUENCY, ESPECIALLY FOR UNCOMMON DOSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THREE DAYS PER WEEK. WE FOUND DOSING ERRORS WITH DIGOXIN, A DRUG OF NARROW THERAPEUTIC RATIO, IN WHICH THE PATIENT RECEIVED 4X EXCESS.
1570802;1;HOSPITAL WIDE BREAKDOWN OF SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC CHARTS AND ELECTRIC ORDER GADGETS RESULTED IN CONFUSION, NEGLECT, FAILED COMMUNICATIONS AND DELAYED TREATMENTS IN THE DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SURGERY, LEAVING PATIENT WITH PERMANENT MUSCULOSKELETAL DISABILITY AND MENTAL ANGUISH.

1570931;0;THE CLINICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE JAW TIP FROM THE ENDOSCOPIC VEIN HARVESTING BIPOLAR DEVICE BROKE. THE PIECE WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE PT. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF PT INJURY. THE CLINICIAN REPORTED THAT DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE JAW TIP FROM THE ENDOSCOPIC VEIN HARVESTING BIPOLAR DEVICE. THE PIECE WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE PT. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF PT INJURY. THE VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED BIPOLAR DEVICE FOUND THAT THE JAW TIP WAS BROKEN. TESTING HAS SHOWN THAT THE MATERIAL USED IN THE PLASTIC PROTECTIVE CAP MAY WEAKEN THE PRECISION BIPOLAR UPPER JAW AND CAUSE IT TO BREAK. A NEW PROTECTIVE CAP HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ELIMINATE THIS POSSIBILITY. A FIELD ACTION HAS BEEN INITIATED ALERTING ALL CUSTOMERS OF THE ISSUE AND PROVIDING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SAFE USE AND RETURN OF PRODUCT. A F/U REPORT WILL BE FILED ONCE A CORRECTIVE/REMOVAL REPORTING NUMBER IS ASSIGNED BY THE FDA DISTRICT OFFICE.
1571131;0;"THE PATIENT WAS INJECTED WITH JUVEDERM (CONCENTRATION/VOLUME UNK) UNDER THE EYES AND EXPERIENCED ""PUFFY INFRAORBITAL AREA"" ON LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES.

GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1575861;1;DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NEUROLOGIST WAS HAVING COMMUNICATION ISSUES USING A PROGRAMMING WAND. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED BY A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE WHICH INCLUDED REPLACING THE 9 VOLT BATTERY ON THE WAND AND CONFIRMED THE POWER LIGHT STAYED ON FOR 25 SECONDS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE CHECKED ALL CONNECTIONS BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILED. ANOTHER WAND WAS TESTED USING THE SAME HANDHELD AND NO ISSUES WERE FOUND, BUT AFTER USING THE REPORTED WAND WITH A KNOWN FUNCTIONING HANDHELD, COMMUNICATION ISSUES OCCURRED. A NEW WAND WAS SENT TO THE NEUROLOGIST AND THE OLD WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. PRODUCT ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE RETURNED WAND. PRODUCT ANALYSIS ON THE WAND REVEALED THE SERIAL DATA CABLE OF THE WAND PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS AS IT HAD AN INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR AT THE HANDLE LOCATION. ALL COMMUNICATION ERRORS CLEARED AFTER THE SERIAL DATA CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED WITH A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL DATA CABLE.
1575863;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NEUROLOGIST'S (B) (6) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE PERFORMED TROUBLESHOOTING ON THE REPORTED HANDHELD AND AFTER PERFORMING A SOFT RESET THE ISSUE RESOLVED. A NEW HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE NEUROLOGIST AND THE REPORTED HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER TO UNDERGO PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1576340;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WAS HAVING ISSUES ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR PT'S DEVICES. THE OFFICE STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE ERROR MESSAGES ON THE HANDHELD DEVICE BUT DID NOT STATE WHAT THE MESSAGES WERE. THE HANDHELD WAS NOT PLUGGED IN WHILE BEING USED. ONE OF THE PT'S DEVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTERROGATED USING ANOTHER PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. THE WAND BATTERY WAS CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AS WELL AS PERFORM ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.

1577610;1;A SERVICE CALL WAS PERFORMED AT THIS SITE ON (B) (6) 2009. THE ACCURACY TESTING DID NOT SHOW ANY PROBLEMS, THE TESTS WERE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A SUPERDIMENSION CASE, THE PHYSICIAN LOST ACCURACY AFTER RECEIVING A GOOD REGISTRATION VALUE OF 5.3MM (CURRENT SPEC IS <10). AFTER RE-INSERTING THE LOCATABLE GUIDE AFTER TAKING BIOPSIES, THE VISUAL VERIFICATION WAS NOW OFF, IT APPEARED THAT THE LG SHIFTED INTO THE RIGHT MAIN STEM BRONCHUS WHEN THE LG WAS ACTUALLY SITTING RIGHT ON THE MAIN CARINA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT REPORTED.
1577628;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO THEIR MFG CONSULTANT THAT THEIR (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER IS FREEZING UPON INTERROGATION. SOFT RESETS WERE PERFORMED BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. THE HANDHELD IS AT THE MFR PENDING COMPLETION OF PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1577635;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING, WHICH WOULD RESOLVE WITH A SOFT RESET, BUT WOULD REOCCUR LATER. ATTEMPTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, AND TO HAVE THE DEVICE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1577738;1;EPINEPHRINE WAS ELECTRONICALLY ORDERED. FONT ON SCREENS IS SMALL. EXCESS EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION IS CONTAINED ON THE SCREEN. THE CONCENTRATION OF THE DRUG WAS OBFUSCATED AMIDST EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION OF SMALL FONT. PATIENT RECEIVED DOSE 10X MORE THAN WHAT WAS ORDERED. PATIENT SUSTAINED MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
1577745;1;ELECTRONIC ORDER ENTERED IN TO THE CPOE CONTRIVANCE ORDERING THE HOLDING OF SLIDING SCALE INSULIN AT NIGHT TIME. THE ORDER WAS DELIVERED TO AN ELECTRONIC FILE ON THE NURSE'S MODULE. THIS ORDER WAS NOT SEEN BY THE NURSE. INSULIN WAS GIVEN. HYPOGLYCEMIA WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS ENSUED. ORDERS ARE DELIVERED WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO ELECTRONIC FILES OF THE NURSE'S MODULE. THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW CONSISTING OF FAILURES OF THE CONTRIVANCE TO LINK FREE TEXT ORDERS TO SPECIFIC TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS AND TO NOTIFY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS OF NEW OR STAT ORDERS. USER ERROR IS INVARIABLY EXTENDED AS CAUSE TO COVER-UP THE DESIGN DEFECT FACILITATING SUCH ERROR.
1577749;1;THERE ARE INCIDENTS IN WHICH ONE MEDICATION IS ORDERED TWICE AT DIFFERENT DOSES AND SCHEDULES BY THE SAME ROUTE. THE ERROR THREAD IS INITIATED BY HUMAN FACTORS INVOLVING USER UNFRIENDLY INTERFACES AND SCREEN DISPLAYS. IT CONTINUES. THE CPOE CONTRIVANCE DOES NOT ALWAYS WARN OF DUPLICATE MEDICATIONS. THE FONT SIZE IS SMALL FOR THE VISUAL ACUITY OF MANY USERS AND THE SCREENS CONTAIN EXCESS CLINICALLY EXTRANEOUS AND DISTRACTIVE INFORMATION. THE PHARMACISTS MISS IT. UNLESS THE NURSE SPECIFICALLY REVIEWS THE ENTIRE MEDICATION LIST AND SCHEDULE AND DETECTS THE DUPLICATION, THE PATIENT RECEIVES ALL OF THE MEDICATION THAT WAS ORDERED. THE FREQUENCY THAT DUPLICATE MEDICINES ARE DELIVERED, AN/OR GET TO THE PATIENT IS UNKNOWN, AND PROBABLY NOT STUDIED.

THE TYPE OF TEST THAT THE DOCTOR INTENDED TO BE PERFORMED IS UNCLEAR, RESULTING THE RISK OF INCORRECT PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITIES BEING USED. THIS CAUSED LIFE THREATENING ACUTE ASTHMA ATTACK IN PATIENT WITH BACKGROUND ASTHMA WHO INCORRECTLY RECEIVED AN INFUSION OF ADENOSINE. ALL PATIENTS ORDERED PHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS BECOME SUBJECT TO SAID RISK."
1578248;0;THE PT WAS INJECTED IN LIPS. THE PT ALLEGEDLY DEVELOPED GENERAL EDEMA, PAIN, TENDERNESS AND LARGE HARD NODULES.

PER PRODUCT LABELING, THE PRODUCT IS INDICATED FOR USE IN THE MID TO DEEP DERMIS FOR THE CORRECTION OF MODERATE TO SEVERE FACIAL WRINKLES AND FOLDS (SUCH AS NASOLABIAL FOLDS). THE BATCH RECORD, INCLUDING STERILITY TESTING RECORDS, WAS REVIEWED AND MET SPECS, AND DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES WITH THE ALLEGED PRODUCT LOT.
1578421;1;"WHEN A PT HAVING BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL PREOPERATIVELY, BEGINS ITS POST-OPERATIVE COURSE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM OR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, POST OP ORDERS ARE ELECTRONICALLY ENTERED BY DELETING THE UNNEEDED ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN ACTIVE, LEAVING THE ORDERS THAT ARE STILL NEEDED, AND ADDING NEW ONES. THERE CAN BE UPWARDS OF 300 LINES OF ""ACTIVE"" ORDERS ON A COMPLICATED PT. PRECISE AND SAFE POST-OPERATIVE ORDERING REQUIRES A TIME CONSUMING LINE BY LINE REVIEW OF EACH ORDER, COUNTER-INTUITIVELY CANCELING THOSE THAT ARE NOT NEEDED. THIS DOES NOT ALWAYS OCCUR FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT THE TASK IS TIME CONSUMING AND USER-UNFRIENDLY. THE INCIDENCE OF COMMINGLING THE PRE AND POST OP ORDERS IN A HOSPITAL WITH CPOE INSTRUMENTS OF CARE IS UNK, BUT NOT UNCOMMON. AT LEAST ONE PT WAS PLACED AT RISK WHEN THE CLEAN POST OPERATIVE ABDOMEN WAS IRRIGATED BASED ON THE PRE-OP ORDER."
1578747;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT SHE WAS IN A DOSING APPOINTMENT WITH A PT THAT WAS IMPLANTED IN (B) (6)2009.

1581240;1;THE DISPLAYS, FORMATS, LAYOUTS, AND INTERFACES OF THE CPOE TOOLS AT THIS INSTITUTION CONTAIN ELEVATED DEGREES OF USER UNFRIENDLINESS. THIS TOXIC EFFECT ON THE USER IS MANIFESTED BY, TO MENTION A FEW, MORE THAN 20 ELECTRONIC SILOS IN WHICH ORDERS ARE STORED AND EXTENSIVE WORDINESS USING DESCRIPTORS THAT ARE HIGHLY IRRELEVANT TO THE TASK OF THE CARE OF PTS WITH CRITICAL ILLNESS. THIS MANIFESTS ITSELF IN SEVERAL WAYS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE ORDERING OF DUPLICATE MEDICATIONS AND TREATMENTS, SOME OF WHICH GET TO THE PT. THESE SHOULD BE REPORTED TO PHARMACOPOEIA DATA BASES BUT OFTEN ARE NOT. THIS PT WAS BEING INFUSED BOTH TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION AND A CONCENTRATED DEXTROSE SOLUTION, THE COMBINED RATE OF WHICH AND CUMULATIVE DOSE CAUSED PULMONARY EDEMA.
1581253;1;IT WAS FOUND THAT SOME TESTS THAT WERE ELECTRONICALLY ENTERED WERE CAPRICIOUSLY DISCONTINUED OR CANCELLED BY THE DEVICE PRIOR TO THE TEST HAVING BEEN COMPLETED. THIS CAUSED DELAYS AND DISRUPTIONS OF CARE WITH VARYING DEGREES OF ADVERSITY FOR THE PTS AND DISTRUST FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM BY THOSE USING IT. THE ABSOLUTE INCIDENCE OF THIS OCCURRING HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED BUT IS FREQUENT.
1581626;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS HAVING PROBLEMS THAT STARTED 2 MONTHS PRIOR. PER THE PHYSICIAN, WHEN SHE TURNS ON HER HANDHELD, IT STATES ""THE BATTERY LATCH WAS OPENED. SYSTEM WAS PUT INTO SLEEP MODE."" SHE THEN TAPS OK ON THE MESSAGE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN THE HANDHELD TURNS OFF. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. PER THE PHYSICIAN, SHE HAS TRIED USING THE HANDHELD WHILE PLUGGED IN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. ATTEMPTS FOR PRODUCT RETURN HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE."
1581627;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN KEEPS GETTING A MESSAGE ON THE HANDHELD COMPUTER SAYING THAT THE BATTERY LATCH IS OPEN AND THEN THE HANDHELD EITHER TURNS OFF OR EVENTUALLY PROCEEDS. ONCE IT PROCEEDS, A MESSAGE APPEARS SAYING THAT THE TIMESTAMP FOR THE INTERROGATION IS OVER EVENT THOUGH THE PHYSICIAN HAS JUST INTERROGATED THE DEVICE. IT WAS VERIFIED THAT THE HANDHELD WAS FULLY CHARGED AT THE TIME OF THESE EVENTS, AND THERE WAS NOTHING BLOCKING THE BATTERY LATCH. SOFT AND HARD RESETS WERE PERFORMED, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. ATTEMPTS FOR PRODUCT RETURN HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1581628;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER STARTED FREEZING AT THE INTERROGATION SCREEN ON (B) (6)2009. THE PHYSICIAN HAS TRIED A SOFT AND HARD RESET WHEN THIS OCCURS AND IT WORKS SOMETIMES. PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR, BUT ANALYSIS IS PENDING.
1581632;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S (B) (4) HANDHELD WOULD NOT MOVE PAST THE (B) (4) SCREEN. THE MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVE WENT TO THE SITE TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROBLEM. A HARD RESET WAS PERFORMED, BY REMOVING AND RE-INSERTING THE BATTERY, AND THE (B) (4) SCREEN APPEARED. THE ALIGN SCREEN APPEARED AND THE DEVICE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE STYLUS TOUCH, AND WOULD THUS NOT MOVE PAST THIS SCREEN. THE NON-WORKING HAND HELD HAS BEEN RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER WHERE ANALYSIS IS UNDERWAY.
1581637;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SCREEN ON THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING AFTER PROGRAMMING. THEN WHEN THE PHYSICIAN WOULD INTERROGATE THE DEVICE FOLLOWING THE SCREEN FREEZE, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SETTINGS WERE BACK AT THE PREVIOUS STIMULATION SETTINGS AND HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED AS INTENDED. SOFT RESETS HAD TEMPORARILY RESOLVED ISSUE IN THE PAST, BUT THE HAND HELD IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY ANYMORE, PER THE PHYSICIAN. THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER'S EUROPEAN OFFICE, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED BY THE U.S. OFFICE FOR ANALYSIS TO DATE.
1581638;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD NO LONGER HOLD A CHARGE WHEN IT WAS UNPLUGGED. WHEN THE PHYSICIAN UNPLUGS THE HANDHELD, THE BATTERY INDICATOR SHOWS THAT IT IS ALMOST EMPTY. PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER'S EUROPEAN OFFICE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED BY THE U.S. OFFICE TO DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1581640;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHILE IN SURGERY FOR A DEVICE REPLACEMENT, THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER DISPLAYED AN ERROR MESSAGE WHEN TRYING TO PROGRAM THE PATIENT'S DATA. THE PHYSICIAN THEN USED A DIFFERENT HANDHELD TO SUCCESSFULLY PROGRAM THE PATIENT'S DEVICE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS EMI FROM DEVICES IN THE OPERATING ROOM, BUT PROPER FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HANDHELD CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AT THIS TIME. ATTEMPTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ARE IN PROGRESS.
1581645;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE USER'S HANDHELD WOULD CONTINUALLY FREEZE FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATIONS. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD WOULD TEMPORARILY RESOLVE THE FREEZING SCREEN; HOWEVER, THE SITE REQUESTED THAT A NEW DEVICE BE SENT TO REPLACE THE NON-WORKING DEVICE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE NON-WORKING DEVICE FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE. HOWEVER, IT IS KNOWN THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THIS TYPE OF SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B) (6) HANDHELD COMPUTER AND CYBERONICS (B) (4) SOFTWARE."

1581917;1;THE PT WAS BEING TREATED FOR A SCAR-RELATED ATRIAL FLUTTER ALONG A LINE FROM THE ATRIOTOMY SITE ON THE LATERAL WALL OF THE RIGHT ATRIUM TO THE LATERAL TRICUSPID VALVE USING A CARTO RMT WHERE A THERMOCOOL CATHETER WAS BEING MANUALLY MANIPULATED BY THE PHYSICIAN. DURING THE MAPPING ABLATION PHASE, THE CARTO DISPLAYED AN HOUR GLASS ON THE MONITOR SCREEN OVER THE MAP AND THE CATHETER COULD NOT BE VISUALIZED IN REALTIME OR POINTS ACQUIRED FOR A BRIEF PERIOD. THERE WERE ABOUT 260 POINTS AT THAT TIME. THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR THIS CARTO SYSTEM. WHEN THE SCREEN UNFROZE, THE CATHETER HAD MIGRATED A FEW MILLIMETERS OFF ON THE AV NODE. THE PHYSICIAN HAD ALSO NOTED DURING THE LAST 3-4 POINT BURNS, THE ABLATION POINTS LANDED HIGHER THAN WHERE THE ICON WAS LOCATED. THE PT DEVELOPED COMPLETE HEART BLOCK DUE TO THE CATHETER ABLATING THE AV NODE AS THE CATHETER POSITION DISPLAY ON CARTO WAS ERRONEOUS. THE PT HAD AN EXISTING BACK UP IMPLANTED PACEMAKER EXISTING, BUT IS PACEMAKER DEPENDENT AFTER THE EVENT. THE PHYSICIAN HAD STATED THAT THE PT HAD HEART SURGERY IN THE EARLY 1960'S FOR ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT. (B) (4). INVESTIGATION IS STILL IN PROGRESS AND A SUPPLEMENTAL WILL BE SUBMITTED. FOLLOWING THIS COMPLAINT AND TWO HOURS AFTER REPORTING THIS COMPLAINT, BIOSENSE WEBSTER FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER WAS ON SITE TO TEST THE SYSTEM WHICH WAS CONFIRMED TO BE WORKING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. THE CUSTOMER WAS USING A REFSTAR PLUS PATCH WITH THE CARTO RMT SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT APPROVED.
1582304;0;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE PROVUE PROBE IS DRIPPING.  NO ERROR MESSAGES WERE POSTED.  THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THE PROVUE WAS TAKEN OUT OF USE.  NO ERRONEOUS RESULTS WERE POSTED.PROBE ISSUES CAN LEAD TO THE DILUTION OF REAGENTS AND SAMPLES, CARRYOVER, AND CROSS-CONTAMINATION WHICH MAY LEAD TO ERRONEOUS TEST RESULTS. AN OCD FIELD ENGINEER (FE) ARRIVED AT THE CUSTOMER SITE AND OBSERVED THE PROBE BENT AND DRIPPING.  THE FE REPLACED THE PROBE AND PROBE BELT.  FE TESTED FUNCTIONAL OPERATION.  REPLACEMENT OF THE PROBE AND PROBE BELTHAS RETURNED THE INSTRUMENT TO EXPECTED OPERATION. THIS CUSTOMER HAS NOT LOGGED ANY COMPLAINTS AGAINST THIS ANALYZER SINCE THE REPAIR.(B) (4)
1582400;1;THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED EXP DATE FOR THIS DEVICE. TECHS WENT OUT AND EVALUATED THE DEVICE IN THE FIELD ON 12/16/2009. EVAL SUMMARY - THE SAID SERVER WAS EVALUATED IN THE FIELD. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION WAS DEFECTIVE HARDWARE. ALTHOUGH, THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR PT DATA LOSS, NO DATA WAS LOST. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING VIA CAPA (B) (4). THIS IS NOT A SINGLE USE DEVICE. INITIAL REPORTER CALLED AND MENTIONED THAT THEY NOTICED THAT THE SERVER WAS FROZEN AND WAS NOT REACTING TO ANY COMMANDS ON KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. USER ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS 1 GREEN LIGHT ON THE SERVER. SHE THEN REBOOTED THE SERVER BY HITTING THE WHITE BUTTON ON THE SERVER AND TRIED TO RESTART IT. SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE DID THIS A FEW TIMES AND THE SERVER WAS NOT COMING UP. THERE WAS NO DATA LOSS AS A RESULT OF THIS MALFUNCTION. MT - 7976, (B) (4).
1582653;0;THE ACCOUNT ALLEGES THAT THE PT PENDANT CABLE BECAME DISCONNECTED FROM THE PENDANT, AND HAD EXPOSED WIRES. THE TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE PT PENDANT, WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE DEVICE OPERATES NORMALLY. PURSUANT TO OUR RESPONSE TO WARNING LETTER 2008-DT-04, HILL-ROM IS CONTINUING ITS RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF EVENTS FOR REPORTABILITY. THIS EFFORT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE ARE CURRENT.
1583558;0;THE COMPLAINT DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE MFG BATCH RECORD REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE MET ALL MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AS DEVICE PERFORMANCE WAS LIMITED DUE TO ANATOMICAL/PROCEDURE FACTORS. (B)(4). IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CORONARY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, STENT DAMAGE OCCURRED. THE LESION WAS LOCATED IN A MODERATELY CALCIFIED AND TORTUOUS CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO CROSS THE LESION WITH A 3.00X12MM VERIFLEX (LIBERTE) STENT AND WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THE LESION. WHEN HE PULLED THE STENT BACK THROUGH THE CLS 3.5 RUNWAY GUIDE CATHETER, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE STENT WAS FLARED. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A NON BSC DEVICE. THE PT STATUS IS LISTED AS OK WITH NO COMPLICATIONS REPORTED.
1583572;1;"A SERVICE CALL WAS PERFORMED AT THIS SITE ON 12/11/09. A COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM, THE COMPUTER PC, WAS REPLACED. THE PC WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, AND THE REPORT SHOWED THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PC WAS COMPROMISED BY THE INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE ON THE PC BY THE SITE. IN ADDITION, THE GRAPHICS SETTINGS HAD BEEN CHANGED. THE USER MANUAL STATES: ""YOUR SUPERDIMENSION / BRONCHUS SYSTEM COMES WITH ALL THE NECESSARY APPLICATION SOFTWARE PREINSTALLED. NO FURTHER SOFTWARE INSTALLATION IS REQUIRED. CAUTION INSTALLING ANY OTHER SOFTWARE ON THE SUPERDIMENSION/BRONCHUS SYSTEM WILL DAMAGE THE SYSTEM. NO OTHER SOFTWARE SHOULD BE INSTALLED ON THE SUPERDIMENSION/BRONCHUS SYSTEM"". THERE WAS NO INJURY TO THE PATIENT REPORTED. IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, THIS EVENT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE COMPUTER, A COMPONENT OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, WOULD NOT BOOT UP. THE SITE REPORTED GETTING A MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN STATING THE VIDEO SIGNAL WAS NOT DETECTED EVEN AFTER MULTIPLE POWER CYCLES. THE SUPERDIMENSION PORTION OF THE CASE WAS CANCELLED WITH THE PATIENT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PATIENT REPORTED."
1583666;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT HOLDING A CHARGE. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND THE BATTERY WAS STILL NOT CHARGED. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED WHICH DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MFR FOR ANALYSIS, BUT HAS YET TO BE PERFORMED.
1583668;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING AN ANALYSIS OF A HANDHELD COMPUTER NO LONGER IN USE BY THE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE, THAT MAIN BATTERY WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE WHILE ON AC POWER. THE CASE FOR THE ANOMALY IS ASSOCIATED WITH BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTIONS ON THE HANDHELD MAIN BOARD. AFTER THE BROKEN CONNECTIONS WERE RESOLDERED TO THE MAIN BOARD, NO FURTHER ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

IT WAS REPORTED SHE HAD DONE RESETS AND IT ALWAYS STILL HAPPENS. THE SCREEN IS FREEZING IS ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. A FLASHCARD REINSERTION RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THIS IS A KNOWN EVENT WITH 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE HANDHELD IS NOT BEING RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER.
1584195;1;THE CPOE SYSTEM SERVES AND DOCUMENTS ALL TRANSACTIONS OF COMMUNICATION PERTAINING TO THE PATIENT'S CARE. ORDERS ARE ENTERED AND DELIVERED TO AN ANTICIPATED RECIPIENT AND THE ACTION ORDERED IS EXECUTED. THE DEVICE-RECIPIENT INTERFACE HAS BEEN UNRELIABLE WITH SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIES FOR FAILURE NOT YET RESOLVED OR UNDERSTOOD. EXAMPLES INCLUDE ORDERS TO TRANSFER PATIENT FROM ICU TO A NON-ICU BED. PATIENT IS MOVED TO ANOTHER BED BUT RECIPIENT CARE TEAM DOES NOT RECEIVE COMMUNICATION AND WAS NOT AWARE PATIENT WAS UNDER THEIR CHARGE. PATIENT HAD SEIZURES ON FLOOR FOR HOURS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. OTHER PATIENTS HAD ORDERS FOR LAB TESTS, CHEMICAL TESTS ON BODY FLUIDS, CYTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BODY FLUIDS, CULTURES ON BODY FLUIDS, PATHOLOGY ON OR SPECIMEN, AND OTHERS THAT ARE NOT EXECUTED BY THE RECIPIENT, LEAVING THE PATIENT UNDIAGNOSED AFTER HAVING TAKEN RISKS FOR A PROCEDURE. SUCH INTERFACE FAILURES HAVE BEEN KNOWN BY THE VENDOR FOR YEARS AS REPORTED BY ITS OWN SUPPORT TEAM.
1584284;0;THE CALLER REPORTED THE PILOT BALLOON OF THE PATIENT'S TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE LEAKED. A NON-ROUTINE REPLACEMENT OF THE TUBE WAS REQUIRED. THE TUBE WAS DISCARDED.
1584778;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS (B) (6) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATION SCREEN. PERFORMING A HARD RESET RESOLVED THE SCREEN FREEZING. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FOR RETURN BUT HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE.
1584787;1;A VNS SALES ASSOCIATE REPORTED THAT HER HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINING 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE FREEZES ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. MFR IS PENDING RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT FOR ANALYSIS.
1584821;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT CUSTOMER RECEIVED AN ERRONEOUSLY LOW CALCIUM RESULT FOR ONE PATIENT SAMPLE. SAMPLE TYPE IS PLASMA, DRAWN IN A LITHIUM HEPARIN SAMPLE TUBE. INITIAL RESULT RUN FROM AN ALIQUOT OF THE PRIMARY SAMPLE TUBE GAVE 1.0 MG PER DL. REPEAT TESTING WAS PERFORMED USING THE PRIMARY SAMPLE TUBE GIVING 8.6 MG PER DL. ORIGINAL RESULT WAS NOT RELEASED AND PATIENT NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FIELD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE FOUND A DIRTY PROBE AND A PROBLEM WITH THE RINSE MECHANISM DISPENSE VOLUME WAS CAUSE, AND CLEANED PROBE AND REPLACED RINSE MECHANISM WATER DISPENSE LINES #3 ON 4 TUBES. PERFORMED A MECHANISM CHECK WHICH PASSED. DISPENSE VOLUMES WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. CALIBRATION AND CONTROLS WERE RUN WITH GOOD RESULTS AND NO FURTHER PROBLEMS REPORTED. INSTRUMENT VERIFIED TO BE PERFORMING WITHIN SPECIFICATION.
1584956;1;REPORTER INDICATED A VNS (B) (4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. THE SUSPECT COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1584957;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH HIS HANDHELD DEVICE. THE PHYSICIAN INDICATED THAT THE SCREEN WOULD FREEZE ON THE INTERROGATION SCREEN AND COULD BE RESOLVED BY RE-SEATING THE FLASHCARD HOWEVER, HE REQUESTED A NEW HANDHELD DEVICE BE SENT OUT TO HIM. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD DEVICE AND HIS OLD HANDHELD DEVICE AND FLASHCARD/SOFTWARE WERE RETURNED TO THE MFR. DEVICE EVALUATION IS IN PROCESS.
1585070;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN OBTAINED AN ERROR MESSAGE ""PROGRAMMED CURRENT IS POSSIBLY NOT BEING DELIVERED"" WHEN SHE TRIED TO PROGRAM A PT TO A HIGHER OUTPUT CURRENT. THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTICS AND THE RESULTS WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS AND WAS THEN ABLE TO PROGRAM THE PT TO THE PROPER SETTINGS SUCCESSFULLY. THE ERROR MESSAGE IS DUE TO AN INTERRUPTION IN COMMUNICATION DURING THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE. BREAKS IN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND GENERATOR CAN BE CAUSED BY EITHER PT MOVEMENT OR RF INTERFERENCE. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD SOFTWARE REVEALED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR COMMUNICATION DISRUPTION TO PREVENT THE GENERATOR FROM RECEIVING THE FINAL COMMAND IN THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING AN ERROR ON THE HANDHELD. THIS IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW IN THE SOFTWARE. THE PROGRAMMED SETTINGS WILL BE DELIVERED CORRECTLY ONCE THE OFF TIME OF THE STIMULATION CYCLE EXPIRES."
1585543;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO INTERROGATE PATIENTS' DEVICES USING HIS PROGRAMMING WAND. THE PHYSICIAN'S WAND WOULD NOT ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH A DEMO GENERATOR EITHER. WHEN A COMPANY REP VISITED THE PHYSICIAN TO ASSIST WITH TROUBLESHOOTING, THE REP TRIED USING HIS OWN PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AND WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTERROGATE THE DEMO GENERATOR. THE REP THEN USED HIS OWN HANDHELD DEVICE WITH THE PHYSICIAN'S WAND AND WAS UNABLE TO INTERROGATE THE DEMO GENERATOR. THE WAND BATTERIES WERE CHANGED, HOWEVER, THE ISSUE DID NOT RESOLVE. THE PHYSICIAN WAS SENT A NEW WAND AND HIS OLD WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. DEVICE EVAL IS IN PROCESS AND HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME.
1585639;0;ATTORNEY REPORTED: IN 2001 - PATIENT HAD AN INCISIONAL HERNIA REPAIR WITH TWO KUGEL PATCHES IMPLANTED. THREE MONTHS LATER - PATIENT WAS TAKEN BACK INTO SURGERY TO REPAIR HERNIA RECURRENCE. DURING THE SURGERY, THE DOCTOR NOTED THAT THE KUGEL PATCHES HAD DISRUPTED AND MIGRATED AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTATION SITE. THE DOCTOR WENT ON TO FIND SMALL BOWEL ADHERENT TO THE KUGEL PATCH. THE ADHESIONS WERE TAKEN DOWN AND THE HERNIA WAS REPAIRED WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF MESH. IN 2003 - PATIENT BEGAN SUFFERING SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN AND BULGING ACCOMPANIED WITH VOMITING FOR WHICH FORCED HER TO PRESENT TO THE ER. AFTER X-RAYS TAKEN INTO SURGERY FOR A HERNIA REPAIR. DURING THE SURGERY, THE DOCTOR TOOK DOWN MULTIPLE ADHESIONS OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL AND A LARGE OVAL COMPOSIX KUGEL PATCH WAS IMPLANTED. IN 2009 - PATIENT BEGAN TO DEVELOP DIFFUSE ABDOMINAL PAIN FORCING HER TO PRESENT TO THE ER. A CT SCAN WAS PERFORMED. AT THAT TIME IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE PATIENT WOULD UNDERGO AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY WITH REPAIR OF THE HERNIA AND POSSIBLE BOWEL RESECTION. PATIENT WAS TAKEN INTO SURGERY. DURING THE SURGERY, THE DOCTOR REMOVED ALL OF THE KUGEL PATCHES AND COMPOSIX KUGEL PATCHES, RESECTED THE SMALL BOWEL AS A RESULT OF OBSTRUCTION AND SCARRING, AND REPAIRED THE HERNIA WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF MESH. THE MALFUNCTIONING HERNIA PATCHES WERE REMOVED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS IN THE MEMORY RECOIL RINGS. AFTER A WEEK OF HOSPITALIZATION, THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED TO HER HOME TO CONTINUE HER RECOVERY. PLAINTIFF HAS SUFFERED AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER PHYSICAL PAIN AND MENTAL ANGUISH. WE HAVE CONTACTED THE INITIAL REPORTER TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TO REQUEST RETURN OF THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATION. THIS MDR INCLUDES ALL PATIENT, EVENT AND DEVICE INFORMATION DAVOL HAS RECEIVED TO DATE. CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. SEE MDR 1213643-2010-0018 FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE OTHER KUGEL PATCH MESH IMPLANTED IN 2001. INFORMATION RELATED TO THE RECALLED COMPOSIX KUGEL MESH IMPLANTED IN 2003, WILL BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RAE.
1585695;0;A HOSPITAL IN (B)(6) REPORTED THAT THE PLASTIC ON THE HEATER HEAD OF AN IW930AEK COSYCOT INFANT WARMER HAD CRACKED. THE HOSPITAL REPORTED THAT SOME OF THE PLASTIC PIECES HAD FALLEN OFF OF THE HEAD. THE REPORTED DAMAGE TO THE HEATER HEAD WAS OBSERVED BEFORE PATIENT USE. (B)(4). THE DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1995. PHOTOS OF THE IW930 WARMER HEAD WERE PROVIDED TO FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE FOR EVALUATION. AN INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT BASED ON THE EVENT DESCRIPTION AND A VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS PROVIDED BY THE CUSTOMER. RESULTS: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WARMER HEAD SHOW THE DAMAGE CONSISTENT WITH THE EVENT DESCRIPTION. A LOT CHECK REVEALED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE FOR UNITS MANUFACTURED IN 1995. CONCLUSION: THE IW930 IS A MOBILE WARMER CAN BE DAMAGED DURING TRANSPORT. FURTHERMORE, THE WARMER HEAD CAN BE ROTATED FOR USE, MAKING IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO IMPACT DAMAGE FROM COLLISIONS WITH HOSPITAL DOORS OR WALLS. THE OBSERVED DAMAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH IMPACT DAMAGE, POSSIBLY CAUSED DURING TRANSPORT OF THE WARMER FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER. BASED ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS PROVIDED, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE WARMER HEAD HAD BEEN IMPACTED AND CRACKED. THE CRACKS WIDENED OVER TIME, EVENTUALLY CAUSING PIECES OF THE PLASTIC CASE TO BREAK OFF OF THE HEAD.
1585756;1;IT WAS REPORTED TO THE MFR THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD'S SCREEN HAS BEEN FREEZING DURING USE.

1604112;0;DEVICE MALFUNCTION: BALLOON RUPTURE. SYMPTOMS / AE: NONE. TIME OF MALFUNCTION: DURING THE PROCEDURE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) PROCEDURE, IN A HEAVILY CALCIFIED, 90% STENOSED LESION, THE BALLOON RUPTURED AT 12 ATMOSPHERE (ATM), BELOW THE RATED BURST PRESSURE (RBP). THE BALLOON WAS REPLACED. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE PT SEQUELA REPORTED. (B)(4). EVAL SUMMARY: QUALITY ASSURANCE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE BALLOON CATHETER WAS RETURNED WITH BLOOD IN AND ON THE BALLOON, IN THE INFLATION LUMEN, ON THE OUTER MEMBER, AND ON THE HYPOTUBE. THERE WAS CONTRAST IN THE BALLOON AND IN THE INFLATION LUMEN. THE BALLOON WAS LOOSELY FOLDED. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE NOTED TO THE BALLOON CATHETER. A NEW INDEFLATOR, FILLED WITH WATER, WAS USED TO PRESSURIZE THE BALLOON TO RBP OF 18 ATM WHEN FLUID CAME OUT OF A PINHOLE ON THE BALLOON AT THE MIDDLE PORTION, 7 MM DISTAL TO THE PROXIMAL MARKER. THERE WAS A SCRATCH ON THE BALLOON ALONG THE PINHOLE FOR A LENGTH OF 1 MM. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING HAS REVIEWED INCIDENT INFO AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED PRODUCT. BALLOON RUPTURES CAN BE AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS. REPORTEDLY, THIS WAS AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) CASE, AND THE LESION WAS HEAVILY CALCIFIED AND 90% STENOSED, WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED. ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED CATHETER IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTED USE OF THE DEVICE. THE PRESENCE OF BLOOD AND CONTRAST IN THE INFLATION LUMEN AND THE BALLOON ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE CATHETER WAS PREPARED FOR USE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH A LEAK OR BALLOON RUPTURE. A NEW INDEFLATOR WAS USED IN ATTEMPT TO PRESSURIZE THE CATHETER AND THE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A PINHOLE RUPTURE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A SCRATCH EVIDENT ON THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE BALLOON ALONG THE PINHOLE, INDICATING THE BALLOON MATERIAL MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED MECHANICAL DAMAGE AT SOME POINT DURING THE PROCEDURE. SINCE THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY LEAKS NOTED DURING PRODUCT PREPARATION FOR USE, THIS MAY FURTHER SUGGEST THAT THE BALLOON MATERIAL WAS NOT DAMAGED PRIOR TO USE. IF THE BALLOON EXPERIENCES MECHANICAL DAMAGE DURING THE PROCEDURE, THIS CAN CAUSE THE BALLOON MATERIAL TO WEAKEN AND RUPTURE DURING AN ATTEMPT TO INFLATE THE BALLOON. IN THIS CASE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BALLOON MATERIAL WAS DAMAGED (SCRATCHED) DURING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER DEVICES AND/OR THE CALCIFIED LESION, SUCH THAT THE BALLOON RUPTURED UPON INFLATION DURING THE PROCEDURE. A REVIEW OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT LOT HISTORY DID NOT REVEAL ANY NONCONFORMING MATERIAL RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT AND ALL LOT RELEASE TESTING MET MFG CRITERIA. IN THIS INSTANCE, BASED ON THE INFO RECEIVED WITH THIS COMPLAINT AND THE RETURNED PRODUCT ANALYSIS, THE REPORTED BALLOON RUPTURE AND MECHANICAL DAMAGE NOTED APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PROCEDURE AND NOT A PRODUCT QUALITY DEFICIENCY. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING WILL MONITOR THE INCIDENT CIRCUMSTANCES. TO ENSURE THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE IS NOT A RESULT OF A POTENTIAL MFG RELATED DEFICIENCY, ALL DILATATION CATHETERS ARE 100% VISUALLY INSPECTED AND LEAK TESTED DURING THE MFG PROCESS. A SAMPLING OF UNITS IS ALSO DESTRUCTIVELY TESTED TO VERIFY RBP AND BALLOON INTEGRITY. THIS MDR IS CONSIDERED CLOSED BY THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE GROUP.
1604349;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE. NO FURTHER DETAILS HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THE DEVICE IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1604380;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN WAS HAVING SOME ISSUES WITH HER HANDHELD DEVICE. THE PHYSICIAN COULD NOT GET THE HANDHELD DEVICE TO TURN ON. THE PHYSICIAN REQUESTED A NEW HANDHELD BE SENT TO HER AND SHE WANTED A SALES REPRESENTATIVE TO GO TO HER OFFICE AND TROUBLESHOOT THE OLD HANDHELD DEVICE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD HANDHELD AS WELL AS TO SEE IF THE ISSUE RESOLVED THROUGH TROUBLESHOOTING ARE CURRENTLY BEING. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
1604381;1;"INITIAL REPORTER CALLED MANUFACTURER AND REPORTED THAT THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT WORKING WITH A PATIENT WHO WAS IN THE OFFICE. REPORTED THAT WHEN SHE TRIES TO INTERROGATE THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR, THE SCREEN WILL SAY ""INTERROGATING GENERATOR"" BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. WHEN THE WAND BATTERY WAS CHECKED, THERE WERE NO BATTERY LIGHTS COMING ON AT ALL. THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT HAVE A 9V BATTERY TO CHANGE IN THE WAND AT THAT TIME TO CHECK FUNCTION. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE EVENT AND THUS FAR, NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN ATTAINED."
1604384;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE HOSPITAL THAT THE HANDHELD WAS NOT ABLE TO START UP. HANDHELD WAS FULL CHARGED BUT THE SCREEN IS FREEZING AT THE START UP. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WERE PERFORMED BUT IT DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY PENDING ON THE HANDHELD.
1604389;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEIR HANDHELD WAS FREEZING UPON INTERROGATION. SOFT RESET RESOLVED THE ISSUE BUT THE PROBLEM WOULD STILL CONTINUE AFTER SOMETIME. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY PENDING ON THE HANDHELD.
1604456;0;A GE REPRESENTATIVE EVALUATED THE SYSTEM AND REPLACED THE X-RAY TUBE. (B) (4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THE X-RAY TUBE IS ARCING. NO PATIENT INJURY WAS REPORTED.
1604792;0;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A BOSTON SCIENTIFIC FIELD REPRESENTATIVE THAT THIS PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AN INFECTION, AND PASSED AWAY DURING A SUBSEQUENT SURGICAL ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT THE ASSOCIATED LEADS. IT WAS REPORTED THE PATIENT�S SUPERIOR VENA CAVA WAS TORN DURING THE USE OF THE LEAD EXTRACTION TOOL. THERE WERE NO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THIS LEAD. (B) (4). PER THE CLINIC, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT SEVERAL REVISION SURGERIES (DATES NOT REPORTED) TO REPOSITION THE IMPLANTED DEVICE. THE PATIENT WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO AN INFECTION AT THE IMPLANT SITE. THE PATIENT WAS EXPLANTED (B) (6) 2010, AND THE PATIENT WAS REIMPLANTED WITH A NEW DEVICE DURING THE SAME SURGERY. (B) (4)
1605606;0;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THIS DEVICE SYSTEM, INCLUDING COMPETITOR RIGHT ATRIAL (RA) LEAD, EXHIBITED AN ATRIAL LEAD IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT GREATER THAN 2000 OHMS. A TECHNICAL SERVICES (TS) CONSULTANT RECOMMENDED ATTEMPTING ISOMETRICS AND MANIPULATION TO ELICIT OVERSENSING, AND PERFORMING AN XRAY. IF OVERSENSING WAS NOT OBSERVED AND THE XRAY RESULTS APPEARED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS, CONTINUED MONITORING WAS SUGGESTED. THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT IN TO THE CLINIC, HOWEVER, NOISE COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED ON THE ATRIAL CHANNEL, WITH ALL LEAD DIAGNOSTIC MEASUREMENTS WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LIMITS. APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK LATER, ATRIAL LEAD IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS WERE OBSERVED GREATER THAN 2000 OHMS. TS ADVISED CONTINUED MONITORING FOR FURTHER OUT OF RANGE IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS ON THE ATRIAL CHANNEL. APPROXIMATELY NINE MONTHS LATER, RA IMPEDANCES WERE OBSERVED TO BE GREATER THAN 2000 OHMS WITH CONFIRMED LOSS OF CAPTURE (LOC) AND INCREASED PACING THRESHOLDS OF 4.5 AT 0.5. THE BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM SALES REPRESENTATIVE WAS TO PERFORM FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING, INCLUDING CHECKING FOR NOISE. TO DATE, NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS WERE REPORTED WITH THIS CLINICAL OBSERVATION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT RA IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS CONTINUED TO MEASURE GREATER THAN 2,000 OHMS. CAPTURE AND SENSING MEASUREMENTS WERE ACCEPTABLE. THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (HCP) WAS ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW OFTEN THE ATRIAL INFORMATION WAS MODE SWITCHING. ALSO, THE HCP WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT SUFFERED FROM ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) OR PREMATURE ATRIAL CONTRACTIONS (PACS). ADDITIONALLY THE REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE AND IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE A RESULT OF AFIB WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE (RVR).
1610029;0;THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. INFO CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REPORT IS ALL THAT IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. IF FURTHER INFO IS OBTAINED, IT WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. THE PT REPORTED THAT SHE EXPERIENCED ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE OF UP TO 480 MG/DL AND SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE THE INFUSION DEVICE PROPERLY DELIVERS THE BASAL RATES. ON (B) (6) 2010, HER BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASURED 480 MG/DL AT 10 PM AND SHE CHANGED THE BATTERY, INSULIN CARTRIDGE, AND INFUSION SET. ON (B) (6) 2010, HER BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASURED 480 MG/DL. AT 12 PM, SHE SWITCHED TO THE BACKUP INFUSION DEVICE. AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT, THE PT WAS IN THE HOSPITAL DUE TO BACK SURGERY AND SHE BEGAN TAKING A STEROID MEDICATION. NO FURTHER INFO IS AVAILABLE. THE PT DID NOT REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OR SECOND PARTY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THE INFUSION DEVICE WAS REPLACED AND REQUESTED TO BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION.
1610123;0;(B)(4). THE RT200 BREATHING CIRCUIT IS NOT SOLD IN THE USA BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO A PRODUCT SOLD IN THE USA. THE 510 (K) FOR THAT PRODUCT IS K983112. THE COMPLAINT BREATHING CIRCUIT IS CURRENTLY EN ROUTE TO FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE FOR EVALUATION. WE WILL PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP REPORT UPON RECEIPT OF THE DEVICE AND COMPLETION OF OUR INVESTIGATION. A HOSP IN (B)(6) REPORTED VIA A DISTRIBUTOR THAT THE PINS ON AN RT200 ADULT DUAL-HEATED BREATHING CIRCUIT ARE BENT. THE HOSP OBSERVED THE BENT PINS PRIOR TO USE.
1610134;0;A HEALTHCARE FACILITY IN (B)(6) REPORTED THAT A BREATHING CIRCUIT OF AN RT241 880 HUMIDIFICATION SYSTEM COULD NOT BE INSERTED INTO THE HEATER WIRE ADAPTOR PLUG DUE TO MISALIGNED PINS ON THE BREATHING CIRCUIT. THIS FAULT WAS NOTICED PRIOR TO PATIENT USE. NO PATIENT CONSEQUENCE WAS REPORTED. (B)(4). THIS DEVICE IS NOT SOLD IN THE USA, BUT SIMILAR TO A PRODUCT WHICH IS SOLD IN THE USA. THE 510 (K) FOR THAT PRODUCT IS K073706. METHOD: THE RETURNED CIRCUIT WAS TESTED TO SEE IF IT COULD BE CONNECTED TO A HEATER WIRE ADAPTOR. RESULTS: THE HEATER WIRE ADAPTOR COULD NOT BE CONNECTED TO THE HEATER WIRE SOCKET IN THE INSPIRATORY LIMB. A LOT CHECK REVEALED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE FOR THIS LOT NUMBER. CONCLUSION: ALL BREATHING CIRCUITS ARE TESTED FOR ELECTRICAL CONNECTION AND CONTINUITY DURING PRODUCTION. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE USER TO DAMAGE THE HEATER WIRE PINS IF THE HEATER WIRE ADAPTOR IS INSERTED INTO THE HEATER WIRE PLUG ON AN ANGLE. FOR BENT OR DAMAGED PINS REPORTED TO US BY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PINS WERE DAMAGED DURING PRODUCTION OR BY THE END USER. BENT OR DAMAGED PINS DO NOT PRECLUDE VENTILATION OF THE PATIENT, BUT PREVENT THE HEATING OF THE GAS DELIVERED. (B)(4).

1612502;0;PROCEDURE TYPE: LAP HERNIA REPAIR. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER: UNIT WAS INSERTED IN USUAL MANNER. WHEN THE TELESCOPE WAS PASSED THROUGH THE PORT, THE PROTECTIVE FLANGE WHICH SURROUNDS THE TELESCOPE DISLODGED AND PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE PORT INTO THE EXTRA-PERITONEAL SPACE IN WHICH THE SURGEON WAS WORKING. THE FLANGE WAS RETRIEVED AND THERE WAS NO HARM OT THE PT. THIS EVENT DID NOT RESULT IN TISSUE DAMAGE OR PT INJURY. THE EVENT DID NOT CAUSE MORE THAN 250CC OF UNANTICIPATED BLOOD LOSS AND THE CASE WAS NOT DELAYED MORE THAN 30 MINUTES AS A RESULT OF THE PROBLEM. ANOTHER DEVICE WAS APPLIED. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED. (B) (4).
1612689;0;THE CUSTOMER CALLED TO REPORT THAT SHE WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT SHE WAS FEELING SICK AND HAD A BLOOD GLUCOSE READING OF 478 MG/DL. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, AND THE INSULIN PUMP PASSED THE PRIME AND HIGH PRESSURE TESTS. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT AS NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. WE THEREFORE CONSIDER THIS REPORT COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE.
1613071;1;"DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER. A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT THE SITE HAD AN ERROR MESSAGE AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE HANDHELD, THE SCREEN JUST FADED. AN RGA WAS ISSUED FOR THE RETURN OF THE HANDHELD AND WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER TO UNDERGO PRODUCT ANALYSIS. PRODUCT ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD AND REVEALED NO ANOMALIES ON THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING A KNOWN GOOD AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. VISUAL INSPECTION DID FIND A BROKEN SOLDER JOINT THAT ATTACHES A SCREW MOUNT TO THE PCB NEAR THE BATTERY CONNECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE BROKEN SCREW MOUNT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BACK PANEL WOULD NOT BE SEATED PROPERLY CREATING AN INTERMITTENT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND MAIN BATTERY. A BAD CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND MAIN BATTERY WOULD CREATE INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHARGING OF THE MAIN BATTERY, ALTHOUGH IT APPEARED TO HAVE NO EFFECT DURING PRODUCT ANALYSIS TESTING. THE SCREW MOUNT HAS NO ELECTRICAL IMPACT ON THE DEVICE OTHER THAN SECURING THE BACK OF THE HANDHELD TO THE PCB SO, THE MAIN BATTERY CAN CHARGE PROPERLY. IT WAS ALSO NOTED DURING VISUAL INSPECTION THAT THE MAIN BATTERY WAS SWOLLEN; THIS ISSUE DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HANDHELD. FURTHERMORE, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THIS BATTERY SWELLING IN UNK, BUT MAY BE DUE TO USER MISHANDLING OR AN INHERENT CONDITION OF THE BATTERY TYPE (I.E. LITHIUM POLYMER ION RECHARGEABLE BATTERY)."
1613098;0;"CALLER REPORTED POTENTIAL PRECISION ISSUES WITH INRATIO TESTING. INRATIO RESULT = 0.9. REPEAT 10 MINUTES LATER RESULT WAS 1.7. LAST WEEK THE METER GAVE A 1.3 AND FRIDAY ((B)(6) 2010) METER RESULTS WAS 2.3. NO CHANGES IN MEDICATION; NO RECENT HOSP STAY. PT STATED THAT INR WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND THERE ARE ALWAYS CHANGES MADE TO THE DOSE. PT HAS BEEN TAKING COUMADIN SINCE 2007. PT STATED THAT HE TOOK 5MG OF COUMADIN LAST NIGHT, BUT REGULARLY TAKES 2.5MG; ALWAYS TAKES MEDICATION AT THE SAME TIME. PT SELF TESTER'S RANGE IS (2.0-3.0). INR REPORTED DID NOT MEET THE PRECISION CRITERIA. INRATIO PRECISION DATA PROVIDED BY END-USER LOT: DATE: (B)(6) 2010, 1ST INR=0.9, 2ND INR=1.7, 10 MINS LAPS BETWEEN TWO READINGS. MEAN = 1.30, SD=0.57, %CV = 43.51. SINCE 43.51% CV IS MORE THAN 20%, THE PRECISION TEST FAILED THE CRITERIA FOR PRECISION. ADD'L INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED. RESULTS 1.3 AND 2.3 ARE EXCLUDED FROM COMPARISON TEST. SINCE TIME OF TEST EXCEEDED THREE HOURS, THERE IS A HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT THE DISCREPANCIES ARE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE STATUS OF THE PT. THREE HOURS IS CONSIDERED A REASONABLE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN TWO READINGS IN ORDER FOR COMPARISON TO BE VALID."
1613204;1;DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. RPTR INDICATED A VNS DOSING SYSTEM (HANDHELD COMPUTER, FLASHCARD, AND PROGRAMMING WAND) WAS FUNCTIONING BUT PERFORMED VERY SLOWLY. THE SUSPECT DOSING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. NO ANOMALIES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR THE COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD. ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAMMING WAND REVEALED AN INTERMITTENT CONDUCTOR IN THE SERIAL DATA CABLE, WHICH PRODUCED COMMUNICATION ERRORS. AFTER A KNOWN GOOD BENCH SERIAL CABLE WAS SUBSTITUTED, ALL COMMUNICATION ERRORS CLEARED.
1613210;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NURSE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. THE NURSE INDICATED THAT THE POWER LIGHT WILL FLICKER BUT THE WAND WILL NOT ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH ANY GENERATORS. THE 9-V BATTERY WAS CHANGED, HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE NURSE USED ANOTHER PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WITHOUT ISSUE AND WAS ALSO ABLE TO INTERROGATE A DEMO GENERATOR WHEN HER HANDHELD DEVICE WAS USED WITH A DIFFERENT WAND. THE NURSE WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT WAND AND HER OLD WAND HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER. DEVICE EVALUATION IS CURRENTLY IN PROCESS AND HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME.
1613228;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD FREEZE AT THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. A HARD RESET WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE BUT THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD FREEZE THE VERY NEXT TIME AN INTERROGATION WAS PERFORMED. THE SUSPECT DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS, BUT ANALYSIS IS NOT YET COMPLETED.
1613372;0;A GE REP EVALUATED THE SYS AND ADJUSTED THE IMAGER FOCUS AND REPAIRED THE COLLIMATOR. SYS OPERATES AS INTENDED. (B) (4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A POOR IMAGE QUALITY. NO PT INJURY WAS REPORTED.
1613560;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WOULD NOT POWER ON. IT WAS STATED THAT THE DEVICE HAD NOT BEEN USED IN A MONTH, AND THAT IT HAD BEEN ON THE CHARGER DURING THAT ENTIRE TIME. NORMAL TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. A NEW PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS SENT TO THE SITE. ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE REPORTEDLY MALFUNCTIONING HANDHELD COMPUTER, AND ASSOCIATED FLASHCARD, RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1613561;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTINUED TO FREEZE AT THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. THE EVENT WOULD RESOLVE WITH A SOFT RESET OF THE DEVICE, BUT HAD BEEN OCCURRING MORE, AND MORE, FREQUENTLY, AND THEREFORE, WANTED THE DEVICE REPLACED. ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE HANDHELD COMPUTER, AND ASSOCIATED FLASHCARD, RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS, HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1613611;1;REPORTER INDICATED A (B) (6) HANDHELD VNS COMPUTER WAS FREEZING DURING INTERROGATION. PERFORMING A HARD RESET WOULD RESOLVE THE SCREEN FREEZING, BUT THE FREEZING CONTINUED TO OCCUR. THE SUSPECT COMPUTER AND FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND ARE CURRENTLY IN PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1613612;1;REPORTER INDICATED A (B) (6) HANDHELD VNS COMPUTER WAS FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATION SCREEN. PERFORMING A HARD RESET RESOLVED THE SCREEN FREEZING.
1613614;1;THE HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND UNDERWENT ANALYSIS. UPON ANALYSIS, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE HANDHELD BATTERY WAS SWOLLEN. NO ANOMALIES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RETURNED HANDHELD WERE IDENTIFIED AND IT PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT THIS CONDITION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE USER HARM, THOUGH NONE WAS REPORTED IN THIS CASE. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THIS BATTERY SWELLING IN UNKNOWN, BUT MAY BE DUE TO USER MISHANDLING OR AN INHERENT CONDITION OF THE BATTERY TYPE (I.E. LITHIUM POLYMER ION RECHARGEABLE BATTERY). CONCLUSIONS: DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1613616;1;INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATE DEVICE SCREEN. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINS 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE. THE HANDHELD AND PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE ARE THE MANUFACTURER PENDING COMPLETION OF PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1613618;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT HE COULD NOT INTERROGATE PATIENT'S DEVICE WITH HIS PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. COMPANY REP WENT TO THE SITE TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUES AND NARROWED IT DOWN TO THE HANDHELD SERIAL DATA CABLE PROBLEM. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND THE REPORTED ALLEGATION WAS VERIFIED. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DAMAGED SERIAL CABLE. THREE BROKEN WIRES WERE FOUND IN THE CABLE. ONCE THE WIRES WERE RESOLDERED ONTO THE CONNECTOR PLUG, THE SERIAL CABLE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HANDHELD AND WAND. THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO MISHANDLING OF SERIAL CABLE. NO FURTHER ANOMALIES ON THE DEVICE PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE FLASHCARD AND NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH FLASHCARD SOFTWARE OR DATABASES WERE IDENTIFIED. CONCLUSIONS: DEVICE FAILURE IS CONFIRMED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.

IF THE PRODUCT(S) ARE RETURNED, LFS WILL EVALUATE IT/THEM AND INFORM FDA OF PRODUCT(S) THAT DO NOT PASS INSPECTION IN A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. ON (B) (6) 2010, THE LAY-USER/PT CONTACTED LIFESCAN (LFS) (B) (4) ALLEGING THAT A ONE TOUCH ULTRA 2 METER WAS POWERING OFF DURING USE. THE PT MANAGES HER DIABETES WITH 3 TABLETS OF GLUCOPHAGE TAKEN DAILY. THE PT INDICATED THAT THE ALLEGED METER ISSUE STARTED ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE/TIME A MONTH AGO. A WEEK AFTER THE ALLEGED ISSUE BEGAN, THE PT CLAIMED THAT SHE DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS OF SHIVERING AND DIZZINESS. THE PT ADMINISTERED SELF-TREATMENT BY DRINKING ORANGE JUICE. PRIOR TO DRINKING THE JUICE, THE PT SKIPPED A DOSE OF GLUCOPHAGE BECAUSE OF THE ALLEGED ISSUE. THE PT WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT METER. BASED ON THE INFO PROVIDED, THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSION: THE PT CLAIMED THAT SHE DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA A WEEK AFTER THE ALLEGED POWER ISSUE BEGAN.
1614958;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEIR HANDHELD WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE UNLESS IT WAS PLUGGED IN. THEY STATED THAT AS SOON AS THEY UNPLUG IT, IT GOES DEAD. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MFR FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY PENDING ON THE RETURNED HANDHELD.
1614960;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE SITE THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE THEIR WAND WORK ON DIFFERENT PTS. THEY USED THE WAND WITH TWO DIFFERENT HANDHELDS BUT IT WAS STILL GIVING INTERROGATION PROBLEMS. IT WOULD EITHER COMMUNICATE REALLY SLOW OR NOT AT ALL. WAND BATTERY WAS FINE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFO AND WAND BACK FOR ANALYSIS HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.
1614966;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PROGRAMMING WAND WAS MALFUNCTIONING AS AN ERROR MESSAGE OCCURRED DURING INTERROGATION AND DURING SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHICH READ ""CHECKSUM BYTE NOT RECEIVED"" AND ""CHECKSUM ERROR."" THE MALFUNCTION WAS ISOLATED AND CONFIRMED TO BE ON THE PROGRAMMING WAND AS A GOOD KNOWN BENCH HANDHELD WAS USED WITH THE PROGRAMMING WAND AND THE ISSUE PREVAILED. THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR AND IT IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING PRODUCT ANALYSIS. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."
1614969;1;"ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY. DURING THE REVIEW OF A PT'S DIAGNOSTIC HISTORY, IT WAS NOTICED THAT A SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS TEST RESULTED IN LOW OUTPUT CURRENT. F/U WITH THE TREATING NURSE REVEALED THE PT IS DOING WELL WITH VNS THERAPY AND THE MOST CURRENT SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS REVEALED THE PT WAS GETTING THERAPY AS INTENDED AS THEY WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. FURTHER REVIEW OF THE PT'S PROGRAMMING HISTORY INDICATED THE EVENT JUST HAPPENED ONE TIME DURING SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS AND WAS CORRECTED ONCE ANOTHER SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED. THE REPORTED EVENT WAS CAPTURED UNDER CAPA (B)(4), WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ""PROGRAMMED CURRENT IS POSSIBLY NOT BEING DELIVERED AT SPECIFIC LEVEL"" WARNING MESSAGE WAS AN UNDETECTED COMMUNICATION INTERRUPTION DURING THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE. BREAKS IN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HANDHELD AND GENERATOR CAN BE CAUSED BY PT MOVEMENT OR RF INTERFERENCE. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD SOFTWARE REVEALED THAT, DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A COMMUNICATION DISRUPTION TO PREVENT THE GENERATOR FROM RECEIVING THE FINAL COMMAND IN THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING AN ERROR ON THE HANDHELD."
1614978;1;"REVIEW OF PROGRAMMING HISTORY REVEALED WHEN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE VNS PT'S DEVICE, THE RESULTS SHOWED LOW FOR OUTPUT CURRENT PORTER IN (B)(6) 2007. THE ERROR MESSAGE ""PROGRAMMED CURRENT POSSIBLY NOT DELIVERED AT SPECIFIED LEVEL, (POSSIBLY LIMITED BY BATTERY VOLTAGE, LEAD IMPEDANCE OR OTHER REASONS)"" WAS MOST LIKELY RECEIVED. FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WAS PERFORMED ON THE PT'S DEVICE THAT REVEALED PROPER DEVICE FUNCTION IN (B)(6) 2007. INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AND IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ""PROGRAMMED CURRENT IS POSSIBLY NOT BEING DELIVERED AT SPECIFIC LEVEL"" ERROR MESSAGE WAS AN UNDETECTED COMMUNICATION DISRUPTION DURING THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE. INTERRUPTION IN COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE GENERATOR AND THE HANDHELD CAN BE CAUSED BY RF INTERFERENCE OR PT MOVEMENT. ANALYSIS OF THE HANDHELD SOFTWARE REVEALED THAT, DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A COMMUNICATION DISRUPTION TO PREVENT THE GENERATOR FROM RECEIVING THE FINAL COMMAND IN THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING AN ERROR ON THE HANDHELD. IF THIS COMMAND IS NOT RECEIVED, A STIMULATION BURST AT THE NEW PARAMETERS WILL NOT BE INITIATED UNTIL THE PROGRAMMED OFF TIME EXPIRES. IF THE PROGRAMMED OUTPUT CURRENT AMPLITUDE IS INCREASED AND AN INTERROGATION IS PERFORMED BEFORE A STIMULATION BURST HAS BEEN DELIVERED AT THE NEW AMPLITUDE, THE VALUE OF THE LAST DELIVERED CURRENT LEVEL REPORTED TO THE HANDHELD WILL BE LESS THAN THE PROGRAMMED CURRENT SETTING. THE HANDHELD WILL COMPARE THESE VALUES AND DISPLAY THE MESSAGE OF LOW OUTPUT CURRENT. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE PROGRAMMED OUTPUT CURRENT AMPLITUDE IS INCREASED AND A DIAGNOSTIC TEST IS PERFORMED IN WHICH THE PROGRAMMING SEQUENCE IS ALSO DISRUPTED IN THE SAME MANNER WITHIN THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST, BUT THE TEST IS ALLOWED TO COMPLETE, LOW OUTPUT CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC TEST RESULTS WILL BE DISPLAYED.

1617352;0;(B) (4). (B) (4). PROCEDURE: COLOSTOMY TAKE DOWN. ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER: DURING THE PROCEDURE, ALL PREPARATION AND FIRING APPEARED NORMAL. UPON REMOVAL OF EEA STAPLER FROM THE ANASTOMOSIS, THE SURGEON HAD DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE STAPLER. AFTER USING CONSIDERABLE FORCE TO REMOVE THE EEA STAPLER, THE ANVIL DETACHED WHILE STILL INSIDE BOWEL PROXIMAL TO THE ANASTOMOSIS. THE SURGEON REMOVED THE ANVIL THROUGH THE ANASTOMATIC STAPLE LINE, WHICH WAS NOT IN-TACT. UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION, THERE WERE NO STAPLES VISIBLE ON THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE STAPLE LINE, NOR POSTERIOR SIDE OF THE STAPLE LINE. THERE WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF STAPLES VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CIRCULAR ANASTOMOSIS. THERE WERE NO STAPLES PRESENT ON THE EEA BARREL AFTER FIRING. THE SURGEON HAD TO REDO THE ENTIRE ANASTOMOSES WITH AN (B) (4) CDH STAPLER. AN UNINTENDED TEMPORARY ILEOSTOMY WAS PERFORMED, WHICH WILL RESULT IN RE-OPERATION FOR ILEOSTOMY CLOSURE. THE INCIDENT RESULTED IN A THREE HOUR EXTENSION IN SURGERY. BEING THAT THE ANTERIOR STAPLE LINE WAS MISSING, THE SURGEON SUTURED THE ANASTOMOTIC STAPLE LINE. HOWEVER, AFTER REALIZING THAT THE POSTERIOR STAPLE WAS ALSO MISSING, THE SURGEON TOOK DOWN THE ENTIRE ANASTOMOSIS AND RE-ANASTOMOSED THE COLON TO THE RECTUM USING AN ETHICON CDH STAPLER. A TEMPORARY DIVERTING ILEOSTOMY WAS THEN PERFORMED.

1624148;1;"ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTER, PTS HAD TO BE RE-IMAGED (X-RAYED). THE DEVICE IN QUESTION WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY BY STRYKER PERSONNEL. ON (B) (6) 2010, (B) (6) FROM THE CLINIC CALLED AND STATED THAT MORNING USERS IN THE OPERATING ROOM WERE HAVING PROBLEMS PULLING UP IMAGES FROM THEIR (B) (6) SERVER. HE MENTIONED THAT THOSE IMAGES WERE AVAILABLE ON THE PRODUCTION SERVER, BUT THE IMAGES DID NOT SYNCHRONIZE OVER THEIR BACKUP SERVER. OPERATING ROOMS ARE CONNECTED TO THE BACKUP SERVER TO PULL IMAGES FROM WITHIN THE OR. DUE TO THIS ISSUE, THEY HAD TO RE X-RAY A COUPLE PTS THAT MORNING. THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED BY LOGGING INTO THE MAIN PRODUCTION SERVER REMOTELY WHICH REVEALED THAT THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE HAD STALLED WHICH HAD PREVENTED THE IMAGE DATA FROM REPLICATING ACROSS TO THE BACKUP SERVER. SINCE THE OR WAS POINTED TO THE BACKUP SERVER AND THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE HAD STALLED, THE USER WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE IMAGE DATA. ON 02/26/2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON THIS CASE REVEALED THAT THE SITE HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST. IT APPEARS THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MISSING IMAGES ON THE BACKUP SERVER IS RELATED TO A MIDDLEWARE CONFIGURATION INTERFACE WHICH HAD BEEN SENDING ADD'L INFO TO THE POWER SERVER CONSTRAINING THE (B) (6) DATA BASE. THIS INFO IS NOT USED OR DISPLAYED BY OFFICEPACS AND IS NOT NEEDED FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, THIS (B) (4) INFO, SUCH AS PT ADDRESSES HAD CONSTRAINED THE (B) (6) DATABASE TO THE POINT WHERE THE SYSTEM WAS FREEZING; THIS CAUSED THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE TO FAIL. AFTER CONFIGURING THE (B) (4) INTERFACE BY INSTALLING A FILTER TO PREVENT THE INFO THAT IS NOT NEEDED FROM GETTING STORED BY THE (B) (4) DATABASE, NORMAL SYSTEM OPERATION RESUMED AND THE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE WORKING WELL. PT INFO WAS NOT LOST OR CORRUPTED, BUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE BACKUP SERVER UNTIL THE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE WAS MANUALLY RESTARTED. THE USER REPORTED THAT THE PTS WERE REIMAGED ON (B) (6) 2010 BEFORE THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED. THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO AN (B) (4) CONSTRAINT CAUSED BY AN INCORRECT CONFIGURATION OF THE (B) (4) INTERFACE. THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE.

THE 98% STENOSED LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE SEVERELY CALCIFIED LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN USED A 1.5X15MM ROTA. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A UNKNOWN 2.0X15MM BALLOON, WHICH REDUCED THE STENOSIS TO 70%. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER 2.25X16MM TAXUS LIBERTE STENT. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT STATUS REPORTED AS ""STABLE"". HOWEVER, THE RETURNED PRODUCT REVEALED STENT DAMAGE. (B)(4) - A VISUAL AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION IDENTIFIED STENT DAMAGE. STRUTS ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STENT WERE MISALIGNED. THE HYPOTUBE WAS KINKED APPROXIMATELY 44 CM FROM THE CATHETER'S STRAIN RELIEF. THE PROXIMAL END OF THE BALLOON WAS PARTIALLY INFLATED. THE TIP SECTION OF THE DEVICE WAS VISUALLY AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED AND NO ISSUES WERE NOTED WITH ITS PROFILE THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. A 0.015 INCH PRODUCT MANDREL WAS INSERTED THROUGH THE LUMEN WITH NO RESTRICTIONS NOTED. SOLIDIFIED BLOOD WAS PRESENT WITHIN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE INFLATION LUMEN, THEREFORE INDICATING THE DEVICE HAD BEEN USED IN VIVO. NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT ANALYSIS OR EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE MANUFACTURING BATCH RECORD REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE MET ALL MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS.

CLIN NEUROL NEUROSURG. 2010; 112(1):47-53. SUMMARY: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A STUDY OF 65 PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE WHO UNDERWENT BILATERAL SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS (STN) DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION (DBS) BETWEEN MARCH 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 2006 AND HAD BEEN MANAGED FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WITHIN CONVENTIONAL PROGRAMMING BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE USEFULNESS OF THE VISUAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE CONTACTS IN DBS PROGRAMMING, AND COMPARED THE OUTCOME OF STN BEFORE AND AFTER REPROGRAMMING GUIDED BY THE FUSED IMAGE OF MRI AND CT. REPORTABLE EVENT: 15 PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ""POOR LOCATORS"" AFTER CT IMAGING. POOR LOCATORS HAD EITHER ONE OR BOTH LEADS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE STN. IT WAS NOTED THAT UPDRS PART II SCORED IN BOTH ON AND OFF MEDICATION STATED WORSENED AFTER REPROGRAMMING. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE AXIAL SYMPTOMS IN UPDRS PART II TENDED TO WORSEN IN THE ON AND OFF MEDICATION STATES. THE CHANGES IN SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE GOOD LOCATORS GROUP IN THE ON-MEDICATIONS STATE. IT WAS NOTED THAT FIVE LEADS HAD GOOD MICROELECTRODE SIGNALS. THE OTHER 18 LEADS WERE NOTED TO HAVE POOR MICROELECTRODE RECORDING SIGNALS DURING IMPLANT. FOUR PATIENTS UNDERWENT REOPERATION AFTER COMPLETION OF THE STUDY WHICH RESULTED IN BETTER OUTCOME. THE REMAINING TEN LEADS WERE BEING CONSIDERED FOR RE-OPERATION. REFERENCE MFR REPORT #3007566237201001741. SEE LITERATURE ARTICLE ATTACHED TO MFR REPORT #3007566237201001696. (B) (4)."

1627049;1;THIS IS COMPUTER HARDWARE. THE PACS SOFTWARE RUNS ON THE HARDWARE. IN THIS CASE THE FIRMWARE WAS SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED AND THE SYSTEM WAS STABILIZED. THE PATIENT DATA WAS BACKED UP PRIOR THE FIRMWARE UPGRADE. THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION IS THAT THE FIRMWARE VERSION, THE HARDWARE WAS NOT UP TO DATE. THIS IS NOT A SINGLE USE DEVICE. THE PACS SYSTEM'S SERVER REQUIRED A COMPLETE SYSTEM REBUILD DUE TO IBM FIRMWARE ISSUES. WHEN THIS OCCURS, THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR PATIENT DATA LOSS OR DATA CORRUPTION ON THE SERVER.
1627155;1;ON (B)(6) 2010, A POTENTIALLY SAFETY RELEVANT CUSTOMER COMPLAINT WAS RECEIVED AT OUR COMPLAINT HANDLING UNIT (COMPLAINT 10-00751-IKM-0081-R). AT A CUSTOMER SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SAME FILENAMES ARE GENERATED TWICE AND THEREFORE, ORIGINAL IMAGE DATA WAS OVERWRITTEN. THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PT IS THAT WITHIN ONE SERIES, SINGLE IMAGES FROM ANOTHER PT CAN BE DISPLAYED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE GENERATION OF DUPLICATE FILENAMES IS A SOFTWARE BUG. DURING DISPLAY AND DIAGNOSIS OF SUCH SERIES, THE CUSTOMER CAN CLEARLY DISTINGUISH THE OVERWRITTEN IMAGES BASED ON THE DIFFERENT PT INFO DISPLAYED. THE OVERWRITTEN IMAGES CAN NOT BE RECOVERED, UNLESS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ARCHIVED. THIS EVENT OCCURRED IN (B)(6). SIEMENS HAS RELEASED A CUSTOMER SAFETY ADVISORY NOTICE TO ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMERS AS AN IMMEDIATE MEASURE (C&R 2240869-03/02/10-003-C).

1648164;0;"A PATIENT SUFFERING FROM SEVERE CROHN'S DISEASE EXPERIENCING AN ENTEROCUTANEOUS FISTULA WAS IMPLANTED WITH A 4MM EFP DEVICE IN THE COLON ON (B) (6) 2010. THE PATIENT HAD BEEN OPERATED ON FOR THIS DISEASE AT LEAST ONE TIME PREVIOUSLY, NOT WITH THE COOK DEVICE. OVER THE COURSE OF TWO WEEKS AFTER RECEIVING THE EFP, THE FISTULA TRACT CLOSED, BUT THE PATIENT DEVELOPED ANOTHER ABSCESS AND CONSEQUENTLY, A NEW ENTEROCUTANEOUS FISTULA DEVELOPED. A DECISION WAS MADE TO SURGICALLY INTERVENE IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE DISEASED BOWEL AND CLOSE THE ENTERIC OPENING. DURING THE OPERATIVE REPAIR, THE SURGEON NOTED THAT THE FLANGE OF THE FISTULA PLUG WAS FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE BOWEL LUMEN. THE SURGEON WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE FLANGE WITHOUT COMPLICATION. THE INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGIST, DR (B) (6) BELIEVES THE TENSION ON THE PLUG CAUSED IT TO PULL OUT OF THE BOWEL OPENING AND RESIDE IN A CAVITY THAT ALREADY EXISTED, PLUGGING THE FISTULA TRACT BUT LEAVING THE BOWEL OPENING OF THE FISTULA OPEN. COOK BELIEVES THIS CAVITY WAS PART OF THE ADHESION THAT CAUSED THE ORIGINAL FISTULA. THE DRAINAGE FROM THE BOWEL INTO THE CAVITY RESULTED IN ANOTHER ABSCESS WHICH FORMED ANOTHER FISTULA. THIS REVERTED THE PATIENT BACK TO HER ORIGINAL CONDITION. THE SURGEON DESCRIBED THE BOWEL AS ""WET NEWSPAPER"". THE FLANGE, WHEN RELEASED FROM THE PLUG, MIGRATED INTO A CAVITY WHERE IT RESIDED UP TO THE TIME OF EXTRACTION. IN DR (B) (6) ASSESSMENT, HE BELIEVED THE FLANGE EITHER PULLED THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE BOWEL UNDER THE TENSION APPLIED OR THE FLANGE WAS ABLE TO OBLITERATE THE DISEASED BOWEL AROUND THE FISTULA OPENING WHICH HE COMPARED TO ""WET NEWSPAPER"". THE DISEASED TISSUE COULD NOT SUPPORT THE PRESSURE FROM THE FLANGE AND SO, THE FLANGE WAS ABLE TO MIGRATE FROM THE BOWEL LUMEN INTO THE CAVITY IN THE AREA OF THE ADHESION OF BOWEL TO ABDOMINAL WALL. (B) (6). EVALUATION: NO DEVICE RETURNED FOR EXAMINATION. COOK BIOTECH IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE IF THE MIGRATION OF THE FLANGE LED TO THE FORMATION OF THE SECOND FISTULA. WE ARE ALSO UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE MIGRATION OF THE FLANGE. THEREFORE, COOK BIOTECH DETERMINED FILING THE MDR TO BE PRUDENT."
1648207;1;THE ELECTRONIC RECORD AND ELECTRONIC ORDERING SYSTEM IS USER UNFRIENDLY. ONE OF THE USER UNFRIENDLY FEATURES IS THE COMPLEXITY OF RECONCILIATION OF ORDERS WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE ORDERS AND SPECIFIC RESULTS THAT WOULD BE GENERATED. ANOTHER IS THE COMINGLING OF PREOPERATIVE ORDERS WITH POSTOPERATIVE ORDERS IN THE ELECTRONIC RECORDS OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY AT THE HOSPITAL. THIS GENERATED HUMAN FACTOR CONFUSION SUCH THAT ORDERS WERE NOT EXECUTED NOR WAS IT KNOWN THAT THEY WERE NOT EXECUTED, RESULTING IN MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO DIAGNOSE AND APPROPRIATELY TREAT LIFE THREATENING DISEASE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEATH.
1649070;1;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS ABLE TO INTERROGATE THE PATIENT'S GENERATOR SUCCESSFULLY, BUT THEN COULD NOT DO ANY REPROGRAMMING AS HE KEPT GETTING ERROR MESSAGES. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE GOT ""WEIRD RESULTS"" UPON INTERROGATION. FOLLOW-UP BY A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE REVEALS THAT THE PATIENT HAD HIGH IMPEDANCE ON SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED NOT TO TURN THE PATIENT'S DEVICE OFF AS RECOMMENDED. COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM PROPER FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PHYSICIAN'S PROGRAMMING SYSTEM AND THE PROGRAMMING ISSUE WAS LIKELY DUE TO EMI AS THE PHYSICIAN HAD THE HANDHELD PLUGGED INTO THE WALL AT THE TIME. X-RAYS OF THE PATIENT'S DEVICE WERE RECEIVED AND REVIEWED BY THE MANUFACTURER. UPON REVIEW, A GROSS LEAD FRACTURE WAS VISUALIZED. NO KNOWN PATIENT MANIPULATION OR TRAUMA OCCURRED THAT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEAD FRACTURE, THOUGH THE PATIENT IS DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED AND SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO CAUSE A FRACTURE. THE PATIENT WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR REVISION SURGERY, BUT IT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO DATE. MANUFACTURER REVIEWED X-RAYS OF IMPLANTED DEVICE. REVIEW OF X-RAYS BY THE MANUFACTURER REVEALED A GROSS LEAD DISCONTINUITY. DEVICE FAILURE OCCURRED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY."
1649075;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEY COULD NOT INTERROGATE THEIR VNS PATIENT. THEY KEPT GETTING ERROR MESSAGES AND THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THE PATIENT IS AT END OF SERVICE SINCE THE PATIENT IS FAIRLY NEWLY IMPLANTED. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WERE PERFORMED AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE HANDHELD SERIAL CABLE.

1651604;0;CALLER REPORTED BLOOD GLUCOSE RESULTS OF 500 MG/DL AND 99 MG/DL WITHIN 10 MINUTES ON THE AVIVA SYSTEM.  REPORTED NO ADVERSE EVENT RELATIVE TO DISCREPANCY. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR THE RETURN OF THE SYSTEM, REPLACEMENT WAS SENT. ACCOUNT CALLED AND ALLEGED THAT THE HEAD WOULD NOT RAISE FROM EITHER SIDERAIL. HE CHANGED THE HEAD VALVES AND STILL THE SAME ISSUE. HE SWAPPED THE COILS AND WIRES AND STILL NO HEAD UP. HE CHECKED HIS CPR AND IT IS NOT STUCK EITHER. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE INITIAL REPORTER SENT REPORT TO THE FDA.
1651689;0;OUS MDR - THE ANALYSIS OF THE LEAD DISCOVERED FRAYING OF THE INSULATION AT SEVERAL PLACES. THE FRAYING OF THE INSULATION IS TO BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE FOR THE CLINICAL COMPLAINT. THE OBSERVED DAMAGE MANIFESTATION REQUIRES EXCESSIVE MECHANICAL LOAD AT THE LEAD OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BY, E.G., FRICTION AT THE ICD HOUSING. X-RAY IMAGES OR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES OF ANY OTHER KIND, WHICH COULD PROVIDE INFO ABOUT THE POSITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE IMPLANTED SYSTEM IN THE BODY, WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. THE DEFORMATION OF THE SHOCK COILS AND THE CUTS IN THE INSULATION ARE PROBABLY DUE TO THE EXPLANTATION PROCESS. THE ANALYSIS DID NOT FIND ANY MATERIALS DEFECTS OR MANUFACTURING ERRORS AT THE LEAD. OUS MDR - OVERSENSING WAS REPORTED TO US AFTER AN IMPLANTATION TIME OF ABOUT 16 MONTHS. NO WORSENING OF THE PATIENT'S STATE OF HEALTH WAS REPORTED. THE LEAD WAS EXPLANTED ON (B) (6) 2009.
1651691;0;OUS MDR - IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE LEAD IMPEDANCE ROSE TO >3200 OHM. PACING WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE SENSING VALUES WERE NORMAL. NO WORSENING OF THE PATIENT'S STATE OF HEALTH WAS REPORTED. EVENT AND EXPLANT DATES WERE NOT MADE AVAILABLE. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THIS LEAD WAS EXPLANTED OR IF IT IS STILL IMPLANTED. OUS MDR - THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE ANALYSIS IS THEREFORE, BASED ON THE EXISTING PRODUCTION DOCUMENTS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF THIS DEVICE WAS REVIEWED. THE PRODUCTION DOCUMENTS DID NOT SHOW ANY ANOMALIES THAT COULD BE RELATED TO THE COMPLAINT. ALL MANUFACTURING STEPS WERE CARRIED OUT CORRECTLY. IN SUMMARY, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A MANUFACTURING ERROR.
1652022;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT IMMEDIATELY POST PROCEDURE, ACUTE THROMBOSIS OCCURRED. THE 70-80% STENOSED LESION WAS LOCATED IN A NON-CALCIFIED AND NON-TORTUOUS RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X12MM APEX BALLOON. A 3.00X38MM TAXUS LIBERTE� LONG DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS ADVANCED TO THE LESION AND DEPLOYED. THE LESION WAS POST-DILATED WITH A 2.5X12MM APEX BALLOON. FIVE MINUTES POST PROCEDURE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED ST ELEVATIONS AND THE DISTAL THIRD OF THE STENT WAS 100% OCCLUDED WITH THROMBUS. A THROMBECTOMY CATHETER WAS USED TO REMOVE THE THROMBUS AND THE LESION WAS AGAIN POST-DILATED WITH A 2.5X12MM APEX BALLOON. 5000 UNITS OF HEPARIN WERE GIVEN DURING THE PROCEDURE AND 60MG OF EFFIENT WAS GIVEN POST-PROCEDURE. NO FURTHER PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED. PATIENT STATUS IS SATISFACTORY. (B) (4). DEVICE EVALUATED BY MANUFACTURER - THE COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF THE BATCH HISTORY, HISTORICAL TRENDING, AND SIMILAR COMPLAINT TRENDING REVIEW FOR THE PRODUCT FAMILY WILL BE CONDUCTED. IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. (B) (4)."
1653563;0;"BASED ON THE PROVIDED INFO, INVESTIGATION PERFORMED AND WITHOUT RETURN OF THE COMPLETE DEVICE (BALLOON AND ADVANCER TUBE WERE NOT RETURNED) THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED BALLOON DETACHMENT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE MYNX INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE DEVICE REMOVAL STEP INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: ""IF UNUSUAL RESISTANCE IS FELT DURING CATHETER WITHDRAWAL, PULL THE ADVANCER TUBE AND BALLOON CATHETER TOGETHER THROUGH THE TISSUE TRACT."" THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE MYNX DEVICE DID NOT MEET SPECIFICATION OR PERFORM AS INTENDED. THE REVIEW OF THE LHR (LOT F1002506) DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY ISSUE THAT SUGGESTS THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED INCIDENT. IT WAS REPORTED BY AN ACI SALES PROFESSIONAL THAT A MALE PT UNDERWENT A CORONARY INTERVENTION ON (B) (6) 2010. ACCESS WAS OBTAINED VIA A 6F SHEATH IN THE RIGHT GROIN. FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE, THE PHYSICIAN TRAINED TO THE MYNX, CHOSE THE DEVICE FOR FEMORAL ARTERIAL CLOSURE. THE DEVICE WAS PREPPED AND DEPLOYED PER INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. THE PHYSICIAN FELT RESISTANCE TRYING TO REMOVE THE DEVICE THROUGH THE ADVANCER TUBE. HE DECIDED TO PULL HARDER TO REMOVE THE DEVICE. ONCE THE DEVICE WAS REMOVED, THE DOCTOR NOTED THAT THE BALLOON TIP WAS GONE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED HOWEVER, THE CARDIAC SURGEON PERFORMED AN ULTRASOUND WHICH REVEALED WHAT THEY ASSESSED TO BE THE TIP OF THE DEVICE IN THE ARTERY AND A PORTION IN THE TISSUE TRACT. THIS WAS SURGICALLY REMOVED WITHOUT INCIDENT. THERE WAS NO FURTHER REPORTED CLINICAL SEQUELA TO THE PT."
1653582;1;CERNER'S CPOE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEPLOYED. EVERY TEST IS ORDERED ELECTRONICALLY INCLUDING TESTS ON BLOOD SAMPLES AND RADIOLOGY TESTS IN ADDITION TO MEDICATIONS. IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THAT TESTS ARE SPURIOUSLY CANCELED ELECTRONICALLY AND NOT BY PHYSICIAN ORDER. THE STATED REASONS FOR CANCELLATION ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE EQUIPMENT WITHOUT NOTIFICATION OF THE PHYSICIANS. THIS CASE INVOLVES UNEXPLAINED BLOOD CLOTS IN A PT IN WHOM HYPERCOAGULABILITY TESTS WERE ORDERED, BUT NOT DONE. THEY WERE CANCELED BY THE SYSTEM 30 MINUTES AFTER THE ORDER WAS ENTERED WITH THE REPORTED REASON GENERATED BY COMPUTER BEING: INADEQUATE COLLECTION OF SPECIMEN.
1653583;1;PT MISIDENTIFICATION MANIFESTS ITSELF IN VARIOUS INCIDENTS. ACCESS TO PT LISTS VIA UNIT CENSUS INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A MISS-CLICK MAY RESULT IN A TEST BEING INADVERTENTLY ORDERED FOR A PARTICULAR PT. THE SMALL FONT SIZE AND USER UNFRIENDLY FORMATS OF LISTS REPRESENT ADDITIONAL PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR NEAR SIGHTED USERS TO ENTER ORDERS ON THE WRONG PT. THE PROBLEM IS LESS THAN COMMON. IN THIS CASE, A TEST USING RADIOACTIVE TRACERS WAS ERRONEOUSLY ORDERED. BEFORE IT CAME TO NOTICE, THE PT RECEIVED THE RADIOACTIVE INJECTION INTENDED FOR ANOTHER PT, BUT ORDERED FOR THIS ONE. THE SAME PT HAD MEDICINE ORDERS ENTERED THAT WERE INTENDED FOR ANOTHER PT.

1654898;0;ON (B) (6) 2010, PT REPORTED AN INCIDENT OF ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE RELATED TO KINKED TUBING. PT REPORTED HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS WELL OVER 200 MG/DL. PT STATED HE EXAMINED THE INFUSION TUBING AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS KINKED. PT REPORTED NO OCCLUSION ERROR DISPLAYED ON THE INFUSION DEVICE'S SCREEN. PT STATED HE CHANGED THE INFUSION TUBING. THE PT DID NOT REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OR SECOND PARTY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. REQUESTED RETURN OF THE ALLEGED INFUSION SET FOR EVAL.
1655306;1;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT THE SITE HANDHELD HAS NOT WORKED WELL FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. THE BATTERY DID NOT LAST AT ALL AND THEY WERE NEEDING TO HAVE IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD NOT MAKE IT THROUGH A PATIENT VISIT. THE PRODUCT IS IN TRANSIT TO THE MANUFACTURE FOR ANALYSIS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT THE HANDHELD WILL BE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. MANUFACTURER IS PENDING THE HANDHELD BEING RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS RECEIVED WITH AN AC ADAPTER, SERIAL CABLE, V8.0 FLASHCARD AND WITH THE MAIN BATTERY DEPLETED. THE HANDHELD DEVICE WAS POWERED USING THE RETURNED AC POWER SUPPLY WITH NO ANOMALIES. THE HANDHELD'S MAIN BATTERY WAS FULLY RECHARGED SUCCESSFULLY USING THE POWER SUPPLY ADAPTER. THE POWER BUTTON LIGHT ON THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS AMBER AND THEN LATER TURNED GREEN GIVING THE INDICATION THAT THE MAIN BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED. THE HANDHELD WAS POWERED-ON CONTINUOUSLY USING ONLY THE MAIN BATTERY FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF TESTING THE MAIN BATTERY HAD A REMAINING CHARGE OF 75%. NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD PERFORMANCE WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OR THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE. THE HANDHELD PERFORMED ACCORDING TO FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS. A PHYSICIAN IN (B)(6) REPORTED TO THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THAT THEIR (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS HAVING A PROBLEM CHARGING AND FELT IT WAS RELATED TO THE HANDHELD COMPUTER BATTERY. THE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO FELT THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE HANDHELD COMPUTER NOT HOLDING A CHARGE. AT THIS TIME THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER.
1655311;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEIR HANDHELD COMPUTER HAD BEEN FREEZING. THE SITE DID NOT SPECIFY SPECIFICALLY WHEN THE FREEZING WAS OCCURRING, BUT CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTERROGATE PT'S GENERATORS. THE SITE DOES NOT WISH TO HAVE THE DEVICE REPLACED, OR TO RETURN THE DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS. ATTEMPTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE SITE, AND TO TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE ARE UNDERWAY.
1655342;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE WERE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE HANDHELD AND IT WOULD KEEP FREEZING ON THE INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD IS ON ITS WAY BACK TO MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS.
1655345;1;"IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE SITE THAT THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR HANDHELD. IT WOULD NOT INTERROGATE INITIALLY AND IF INTERROGATION WENT THROUGH, THEN THEY WOULD HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PROGRAMMING. THIS ISSUE OCCURRED WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT PATIENTS ON THE SAME DAY. COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE TALKED TO THE SITE AND INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE A SCREEN FREEZING. HE INFORMED THE SITE TO REMOVE THE FLASHCARD AND RE-INSERT IT. AFTER DOING THAT, THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED; HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO PT AT THE OFFICE TO INTERROGATE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADD'L INFO HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TILL DATE."
1655368;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO INTERROGATE USING HIS PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED BY MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVE AND THE SITE'S HANDHELD COMPUTER APPEARED TO BE CAUSING THE PROBLEM. PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER, BUT ANALYSIS IS PENDING.
1656229;0;(B) (4). IT WAS REPORTED THAT PATIENT'S PUMP WAS EXPLANTED (B) (6) 2009, DUE TO A STAPH INFECTION, 3 WEEKS AFTER IMPLANT. NO PATIENT SYMPTOMS WERE REPORTED. THE TYPE OF MEDICATION, CONCENTRATION, AND DAILY DOSE BEING ADMINISTERED VIA THE PUMP WERE NOT REPORTED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED FROM THE HCP, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SENT IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.
1656460;1;"THE MEDICATION REVIEW SCREEN OF THE SUBJECT DEVICE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT DOSE IN MILLIGRAMS OF COMBINATION MEDICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, NARCOTICS ARE COMBINED WITH TYLENOL IN AT LEAST TWO STRENGTHS. LIQUID NARCOTIC TYLENOL-OXYCODONE COMBINATION IS REPORTED IN ML, NOT MG. THE EXACT DOSE OF TYLENOL IS NOT SPECIFIED AND REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMBINATION MEDICATION DOSE IN THE VOLUME SPECIFIED. CERTAIN FIELDS OF THE GRID DO NOT SPECIFY THE VOLUME, BUT RATHER STATE ""DATE/TIME"" REQUIRING ANOTHER CLICK OR POP UP SCREEN. THE IMMEDIATE KNOWLEDGE OF TYLENOL DOSAGE IN MG IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING EXCESSIVE DOSES. IN THE SUBJECT, 10 ML OF ACETAMINOPHEN-OXYCODONE IS INDICATED AS HAVING BEEN GIVEN 3 TIMES OVER 4 HOURS. THAT MEANS THAT 1950 MG OF TYLENOL WAS ADMINISTERED IN 4 HOURS WHILE THE PATIENT WAS IN A STATE OF STARVATION AND RECEIVING OTHER MEDICATION THAT INCREASE THE EFFECTS OF TYLENOL. THIS DOSE WOULD EQUATE TO 11,700 MG OF TYLENOL OVER 24 HOURS, NEARLY 3 TIMES THE MAXIMUM DAILY DOSE IN OTHERWISE HEALTH PEOPLE. IN THE ENSUING DAYS, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, PRESUMABLY ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS, AND DIED. IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER ETIOLOGY, THE EXCESS TYLENOL WAS THE CULPRIT. THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED AS ETIOLOGY ANTE-MORTEM. THE COUNTERINTUITIVE SCREEN IMPAIRED THE PROFESSIONALS. THE PHARMACIST DID NOT RECOGNIZE AND STOP THE MEDICATION, THE NURSES ADMINISTERED IT, AND THE EXCESSIVE DOSE, CLINICALLY MEANINGLESSLY LISTED AS A VOLUME OF 10 ML -GIVEN 3 TIMES IN 4 HOURS- OF ACETAMINOPHEN-OXYCODONE, WAS MISSED BY THE PHYSICIANS. ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ASCRIBED TO ""USER ERROR"" BY VENDORS. THE DEVICE OFFERS A POTENT PROPENSITY TO LIFE ENDANGERING OVERSIGHTS. THERE ARE OTHER SCREENS ON THIS DEVICE WHICH PRESENT INFORMATION THAT INTERFERE WITH CLINICALLY USEFUL VISUALIZATION OF DATA. THE DATA DOES NOT FLOW TO THE PROFESSIONALS. IT IS NOT REPRESENTED IN A MEANINGFULLY USEFUL MANNER. THE PROFESSIONALS NEED TO HUNT FOR IT. AS SUCH, THE USER UNFRIENDLY SCREENS IMPAIR SAFE MEDICAL CARE CONSISTENT WITH THE IMPEDIMENT TO EXPEDIENT PROFESSIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE DOSE OF MEDICATION AND HOW MUCH WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE PATIENT. THIS SENTINEL CASE OF DEATH IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO USER UNFRIENDLY SCREENS ON THIS DEVICE."
1656869;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HEX SCREWS LOOSENED OVER TIME FROM THE ROD AND REQUIRED A REVISION SURGERY TO REPLACE. REVIEW OF RADIOGRAPHIC AP AND LATERAL VIEWS SHOW 2 LEVEL PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION L4, L5, S1 WITH POSTEROLATERAL FUSION.  IMAGING STUDIES DONE ON (B)(6) 2009 ARE INCONCLUSIVE.  IMAGING STUDIES DONE (B)(6) 2010 VERIFY LEFT S1 SET SCREW HAS LOOSENED AND THE ROD PULLED PARTIALLY OUT. (B) (4). A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS FOR THIS DEVICE WAS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL DEVICE INFORMATION. NEITHER THE DEVICE NOR FILMS OF APPLICABLE IMAGING STUDIES WERE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION. THEREFORE, WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE DEFINITIVE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT.

AT SOME POINT DURING HER HED CHARTING SHE NOTICED THAT A DIFFERENT NURSE'S NAME WAS NOW NOTED ON  BOTTOM OF SCREEN.  ALL OF HER CHARTING WAS CREDITED TO ANOTHER OFF-DUTY RN. THE HELPDESK CONTACTED HED RESOURCE RN AND THE CHARTING WAS ALL REMOVED. B THEN LOGGED IN AGAIN AND RE-DID ALL OF HER CHARTING. IT WAS FELT THAT THE OTHER NURSE HAD NOT LOGGED OFF PROPERLY, CREATING THE 'MIX-UP"". AT THE END OF HER SHIFT, B CAREFULLY LOGGED OFF, BELIEVING THAT THE PRIOR NURSE LOG OFF WAS SOMEHOW NOT DONE PROPERLY. RN C THEN ASSUMED CARE OF THOSE SAME PATIENTS AND SHE LOGGED ONTO THAT SAME COMPUTER. SHE BEGAN HER CHARTING ON HED AND ALSO NOTED SOME TIME INTO HER CHARTING THAT THE NAME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WAS NO LONGER HERS, BUT B. SHE CONTACTED B WHO WAS STILL IN-HOUSE AND NOTIFIED THE HELP DESK OF THE RECURRENT PROBLEM. A TECH WAS SENT TO CHECK OUT THE COMPUTER ON WHEELS. HE SEEMED TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THE UNIT WAS PULLED FROM SERVICE UNTIL HE COULD ""RE-PROGRAM IT'.LESS THAN A MONTH AGO, A DIFFERENT RN ON A DIFFERENT UNIT EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. SHE LOGGED OFF OF HER COMPUTER WHEN FINISHED CHARTING.  NURSE TAKING OVER FOR HER CHARTED ON HED AFTER LOGGING IN AND NEVER NOTICED THAT THE FIRST NURSE'S NAME APPEARED THROUGHOUT THE  PATIENT'S RECORD ON THE NEXT SHIFT. THE DAY SHIFT NURSE FOUND THE ERROR THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SHE RESUMED CARE OF THAT PATIENT.  IT APPEARED ON THE HED THAT THE FIRST NURSE HAD PROVIDED ALL CARE AND MEDICATIONS FOR OVER 24 HOURS. THE HELP DESK WAS NOTIFIED AT THAT TIME AND THE CONCLUSION WAS AGAIN ""LOG-ON ERROR BY NURSE"".  THIS SAME PROBLEM WAS NOTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHILE INVESTIGATING A ""MISSED OPPORTUNITY"" TO GIVE AN ANTIBIOTIC WITHIN 4 HOURS OF ARRIVAL. ALTHOUGH THE PATIENT DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE HOSPITAL UNTIL NOON, THE NURSE'S HED CHARTING INDICATED THAT THE ADMISSION ASSESSMENT WAS DONE AT 0700 WHICH IS WHEN THAT PARTICULAR NURSE HAD FIRST SIGNED ON FOR THAT SHIFT ON THAT COMPUTER. SINCE DISCOVERY OF THE ISSUES, IT NURSES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE SCENARIO, WHICH CAN HAPPEN IF A CERTAIN SEQUENCE OF EVENTS TALKS PLACE. SHORT VERSION IS, THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS DESIGNED.LET ME EXPLAIN THAT LAST STATEMENT:IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE TO LOG INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN LOG OUT OF PART OF THE SYSTEM WITHOUT COMPLETELY LOGGING OUT OF ALL OPEN APPLICATIONS.SEQUENCE OF EVENTS TO DUPLICATE WHAT HAPPENED:NURSE LOGS INTO CARE ORGANIZER.NURSE SELECTS PATIENT.NURSE OPENS FLOW SHEET.FLOW SHEET OPENS IN A NEW WINDOW.AT THIS TIME BOTH CARE ORGANIZER AND THE FLOW SHEET HAVE THE SAME PERSON LOGGED IN.BECAUSE THERE ARE 2 WINDOWS YOU NEED TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM TO SELECT OTHER PATIENTS, DO OTHER TASKS, ETC IN CARE ORGANIZER AND THEN SWITCH BACK TO THE FLOW SHEET. SOMETIMES THE FLOW SHEET (OR BOTH WINDOWS) IS MINIMIZED.NEXT, IT'S TIME TO LOG OUT.NURSE SELECTS CARE ORGANIZER.NURSE LOGS OUT.CARE ORGANIZER CLOSES BUT THE FLOW SHEET IS STILL OPEN AND LOGGED IN AS YOU. CARE ORGANIZER DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE THE OPEN FLOW SHEET WINDOW.THE OPEN FLOW SHEET MAY NOT BE NOTICED BECAUSE IT MAY BE MINIMIZED.NEXT NURSE COMES ALONG AND OPENS UP CARE ORGANIZER.NURSE LOGS INTO CARE ORGANIZER.NURSE SELECTS PATIENT.NURSE OPENS THE FLOW SHEET.MINIMIZED FLOW SHEET IS CHANGED TO THE PATIENT SELECTED BY THE NURSE.NURSE MAXIMIZES THE FLOW SHEET AND BEGINS TO CHART. HOWEVER, THE PRIOR NURSE IS STILL LOGGED INTO THE FLOW SHEET BECAUSE THE APPLICATION WAS NOT CLOSED BY THE FIRST NURSE.WE WERE ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE ABOVE SCENARIO WITH EASE.OK, SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS ISSUE?FIRST, REMINDER TO STAFF TO LOG OUT OF ALL OPEN APPLICATIONS WHEN THEY LEAVE THEIR DEVICE.SECOND, WE ARE DEPLOYING A REPLACEMENT FOR THE CARE ORGANIZER WITH WHAT IS KNOW AS COMMON APPLICATION FRAMEWORK OR CAF. CAF REPLACES THE CURRENT CARE ORGANIZER WITH A CONSISTENT WAY OF DISPLAYING PATIENT DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE FLOW SHEET NO LONGER OPENS IN A SEPARATE WINDOW. IT IS NOW A TAB IN CAF. SO WHEN YOU LOG OUT OF CAF, YOU LOG OUT OF EVERYTHING."

THE SERVER WAS CLEANED PRIOR TO ANY TEST BEING PERFORMED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SERVER WAS DOWN SEVERAL LEVELS ON RAID BIOS/FIRMWARE (V.5.2.0-11844). WHEN THE SYSTEM EVENT LOG WAS VIEWED, IT WAS DETERMINED ON (B)(4) 2010 THAT THERE WAS A HARD DRIVE 3 FAULT. THE SYSTEM TRIED TO RECOVER DRIVE 3 UNSUCCESSFULLY. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT LOGICAL DRIVE 2 WAS CRITICAL. EACH DRIVE WAS SELECTED TO DETERMINE WHAT ARRAY THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH, DRIVE SLOTS 2 AND 3 WERE ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOGICAL DRIVE. DRIVE SLOTS 0, 2, AND 3 WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOGICAL DRIVE. THIS WAS INCORRECT. IT APPEARS THAT THE DOWN LEVEL FIRMWARE WAS THE CAUSE OF THESE ISSUES. THE SERVER HAD TO BE REBUILT. THE FIRMWARE AND DEVICE DRIVERS WERE UPDATED THE CURRENT LEVELS AFTER REBUILDING THE SERVER. TESTS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM WAS RUNNING PROPERLY AFTER REBUILD. THE OFFICE PACS DATABASE WAS RESTORED BACK TO THE SYSTEM AND TESTED AGAIN. THE SYSTEM WAS THEN SHIPPED BACK OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND THEY ARE NOW REUSING THE SERVER. THERE WAS NOT DATA LOSS OR PATIENT HARM REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS COMPLAINT. THIS IS NOT A SINGLE USE DEVICE.

1657976;0;REPORT INDICATES THAT THE PT HAD AND WAS TREATED FOR A RECURRENCE, WHICH IS A KNOWN POSSIBLE ADVERSE EVENT LISTED IN THE IFU. THE REPORT DOES NOT SPECIFY A SPECIFIC PRODUCT PROBLEM AND NO PRODUCT WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITED AVAILABLE INFO, WE ARE UNABLE TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSION AT THIS TIME. ATTORNEY REPORTED: (B) (6) 2002 - PT UNDERWENT VENTRAL INCISIONAL HERNIA REPAIR SURGERY. PT'S HERNIA WAS REPAIRED WITH A BARD COMPOSIX E/X MESH. ON (B) (6) 2008 - PT'S CONDITION WORSENED PROGRESSIVELY, AND SHE PRESENTED TO THE HOSP WITH SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A LARGE RECURRENT HERNIA. PT UNDERWENT REMOVAL OF THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED MESH AT THIS TIME. ON (B) (6) 2008 - PT PRESENTED TO THE HOSP DUE TO A CHRONIC RECURRENT HERNIA AND BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. AT THIS TIME, PT UNDERWENT EXTENSIVE LYSIS OF ADHESIONS AND A BOWEL RESECTION. PRIOR TO THIS, PT SUFFERED TWO OTHER BOWEL OBSTRUCTIONS WHICH WERE RESOLVED WITH MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. ON (B) (6) 2008 - PT CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE PAIN AND SHE PRESENTED WITH A NON-HEALING ABDOMINAL WOUND. BECAUSE OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSIX E/X PATCH AND THE MULTIPLE MEDICAL VISITS AND SURGERIES NECESSITATED, PT HAS SUFFERED AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER PHYSICAL PAIN AND MENTAL ANGUISH.
1658412;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE SITE THAT THEIR HANDHELD IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. THE HANDHELD IS VERY SLOW AND IT FREEZES WHEN INTERROGATING THE PT. ONCE THE HANDHELD IS SWITCHED OFF AND BACK ON, IT BLOCKED AGAIN. TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS WERE PERFORMED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BUT IT DID NOT HELP. NEW HANDHELD WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MFR FOR ANALYSIS. THE FLASHCARD WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS.
1658413;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE NURSE THAT THE HANDHELD WOULD NO LONGER HOLD A CHARGE. SHE STATED THAT THEY PLUG THE HANDHELD AND IT WORKS BUT ONCE IT IS UNPLUGGED THE HANDHELD DIES VERY QUICKLY. SHE STATED THAT IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE A WHILE. NEW HANDHELD WAS SHIPPED TO THE SITE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE OLD HANDHELD FOR ANALYSIS HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TILL DATE. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1658572;0;THE EVENT OCCURRED IN (B) (6). CALLER REPORTS LANCET PROTRUDES BEYOND THE END CAP OF THE MULTICLIX DEVICE AFTER FIRING. NO ACCIDENTAL NEEDLE STICK OCCURRED. NO ADVERSE EVENT REPORTED. REQUESTED RETURN OF SUSPECT DEVICE.
1658762;1;THE MILLENNIUM CPOE SYSTEM FACILITATES ERRORS. THIS IS ONE CASE OF MANY CASES CONSISTING OF DUPLICATE MEDICATIONS AND DUPLICATE INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS APPEARING ON THE ACTIVE INPATIENT MEDICATION ORDER SCREENS. A DEFINITE BUT UNDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THESE DUPLICATE TREATMENTS GET TO THE PT. THE HUMAN TO COMPUTER ORDERING DEVICE INTERACTION IS DISTURBED WITH ONE ETIOLOGY BEING USER UNFRIENDLY SCREEN DISPLAYS OF VITAL INFO TINCTURED WITH ABUNDANT CLUTTER. MULTIPLE PROFESSIONALS ENTER ORDERS. WHILE ENTERING ORDERS ELECTRONICALLY, THERE IS NOT A SIMULTANEOUS USER FRIENDLY OR ANY DISPLAY OF CURRENT TREATMENTS AND WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY ORDERED. THUS, THEIR COGNITIVE AWARENESS IS BLUNTED BY THE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPENSITY FOR MEDICAL ERRORS IS ESCALATED AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH INTRINSICALLY INSUFFICIENT WARNING SYSTEM IN THIS DEVICE. IN THIS CASE, TWO INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS WERE ACTIVE, ONE BEING D5.5NS + 20MEQ KC1 AT 50CC/HR AND THE OTHER BEING D5NS AT 60CC/HR. THE COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION AT THE TASK LIST IS AFFECTED BY THE PERCEIVED OMNISCIENCE OF THE DEVICE GIVING THE ORDER, TINCTURED WITH POTENTIAL ISSUES OF OSTRACISM OF PHARMACISTS AND THE NURSES. THESE DEVICES MUST BE ENGINEERED TO BE SAFER WITH USER FRIENDLY DISPLAYS AND ACTIVE PROCESSES TO PREVENT DUPLICATION OF TESTS, MEDICATIONS, AND TREATMENTS.
1658771;1;THIS INCIDENT TYPIFIES INNUMERABLE SIMILAR INCIDENTS WHEREBY A MEDICATION THAT IS ORDERED DAILY AT TWO DISTINCT DOSES TO BE ADMINISTERED DAILY AT TWO DISTINCT TIMES IS INVARIABLY INCORRECTLY SCHEDULED BY THE MILLENNIUM CPOE DEVICE. THE DEVICE SCHEDULES BOTH DOSES TO BE ADMINISTERED AT THE SAME TIME, THE EARLIEST TIME. THIS CAUSES AN EXCESSIVE DOSE OF MEDICATION TO BE ADMINISTERED AT ONCE, OR ALTERNATIVELY, CAUSING THE SECOND DOSE OF MEDICATION TO BE SKIPPED BY THE NURSE AND DISCARDED AS BEING DUPLICATE. FOR INSTANCE, VENLAFAXINE WAS ORDERED AS 150 MG DAILY AT 9AM AND 75 MG DAILY AT 2PM. THE NURSE TASK LIST SHOWED 225MG TO BE ADMINISTERED AT 9AM. THE E-MAR DISPLAYED THE CORRECT DESCRIPTION IN THE MEDICATION COLUMN, BUT IT WAS NOT SCHEDULED AT THE CORRECT TIME ON THE TIME LINE. THIS DEFECT AND INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY ENDANGERS ALL PTS WHO ARE TO RECEIVE MEDICATIONS OF TWO DISTINCT DOSES AT TWO DISTINCT TIMES.
1659052;0;(B)(4). INFORMATION ANTICIPATED, BUT UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A HEMORRHOIDECTOMY PROCEDURE, THE STAPLES WERE OPEN IN ALL EXTENSION OF RESECTION. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. UNKNOWN HOW CASE WAS COMPLETED. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PATIENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON (B)(4) 2010: PATIENT HAD INTERNAL 3RD DEGREE HEMORRHOIDS, WAS SUBMITTED TO PROCEDURE USING PPH03 IN (B)(6) 2010. HOWEVER, DURING THE PROCEDURE, THERE WAS A FAILURE, WHICH IS NOT USUAL AFTER MORE THAN 200 CASES. THE MUCOUS-MUCOSA SUTURE DID NOT HAPPEN ABOVE THE ANALRECUTS RING WHICH WOULD LEAD TO HEMOSTASIS. STAPLES WERE TOTAL OPEN IN ALL RESECTION OF MUCOUS OF LOW RECTUS, WHICH CAUSED A LOT OF BLEEDING AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO PERFORM MANUAL SUTURE WITH CROMED CAT-GUT 3-0 WITH A LOT OF DIFFICULT. AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, THE PATIENT LOST A LOT OF BLOOD, AND STAYED ANEMIC AND ANALRECTUS PAIN. IN THE 4T POST SURGERY, PATIENT STILL HAD ANAL PAIN AND DIFFICULT TO EVACUATE.

1659585;1;THERE IS PHYSIOLOGIC MONITOR DISPLAY DISTORTION WHEN THE HOST MONITOR RECEIVES OVERLAPPING ALARM INFORMATION FROM THE REMOTE MONITOR IN THE AUTO VIEW ON ALARM (AVOA) MODE WITH THE GE SOLAR 8000I MONITOR AND SOFTWARE VERSION 5.3.AVOA ALLOWS THE NURSES TO CARE FOR A PATIENT IN ONE ROOM AND BE NOTIFIED OF AN ALARMING PARAMETER FROM OTHER PATIENTS IN OTHER ROOMS.  THE ALARM DATA FROM A REMOTE ROOM IS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOST ROOM SCREEN. WHEN A REMOTE BED ALARMS, THE DISPLAY OF OTHER BEDS IN THE CARE UNIT WILL SPLIT TO SHOW THE ALARMING BEDS NUMERICS.THERE IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WHERE THE REMOTE ALARMING NUMERICS OF ONE PATIENT WILL SOMETIMES OVERLAP THE HOST BED NUMERICS CAUSING A GHOSTING OR VIBRATING EFFECT. BECAUSE THE HOST DISPLAY MONITORED VALUES FROM THE REMOTE BED ARE OVERLAPPED IT CAN APPEAR AS THOUGH THE REMOTE NUMERICS ARE FOR THE PATIENT BEING MONITORED ON THE HOST MONITOR. SOMETIMES THE MENU BOX THAT POPS UP ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN THAT GIVES YOU THE OPTION OF SILENCING THE ALARM OR GOING BACK TO THE MAIN MENU WILL FLASH, ALSO CAUSING A SHAKING/VIBRATING EFFECT ON THE HOST SCREEN.  THE SCREEN IS DIFFICULT FOR THE NURSES TO READ WHEN THIS HAPPENS.THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN VERIFIED IN THE GE LAB.AN ITRACK REPORT WAS OPENED IN 10/2006.A SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO VERSION 5.4 MAY CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE INSTALLED AT THIS HOSPITAL IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.====================== MANUFACTURER RESPONSE FOR MONITOR,PHYSIOLOGICAL, SOLAR 8000I======================SINCE 2006 THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPRODUCED AND A SOFTWARE UPGRADE HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR.

CONTINUED ADVANCEMENT OR RETRACTION AGAINST RESISTANCE MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY TO THE PT, DAMAGE TO OR BREAKAGE OF THE GUIDEWIRE, CATHETER, OR OTHER DEVICE. ADDITIONALLY, ILIO-FEMORAL ACCESS VESSEL SIZE AND MORPHOLOGY (E.G., MINIMAL THROMBUS, CALCIUM AND/OR TORTUOSITY) SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO A ACCOMMODATE THE REQUIRED INTRODUCER SHEATH DIAMETERS USING APPROPRIATE VASCULAR ACCESS TECHNIQUES (INCLUDING SURGICAL CONDUIT, IF NEEDED)."
1668689;1;A POST OPERATIVE PT UNDERWENT THE PHYSICIAN ORDERED LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER TEST TO RULE OUT A DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS. THE REPORT THAT THE FINDINGS WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS WAS AVAILABLE WITHIN HOURS. ELEVEN DAYS LATER, LONG AFTER THE PT WAS DISCHARGED, A REPORT OF A CT SCAN PERFORMED ON THE SAME DAY ON THE SAME EXTREMITY ARRIVED, INDICATING SUPERFICIAL THROMBOSIS. THE SCAN WAS NOT ORDERED BY ANY PHYSICIAN. CLARITY AS TO HOW THE ORDER APPEARED SHORTLY AFTER THE DOPPLER TEST WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE SCAN WAS COMPLETED BUT DISAPPEARED AND WAS NOT READ UNTIL IT REAPPEARED 11 DAYS LATER. CLARITY IS UNAVAILABLE AS TO HOW THE CT DISAPPEARED FOR 11 DAYS AND WAS NOT INTERPRETED OVER THAT TIME FRAME. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS NOT LIFE THREATENING. THE PHYSICIANS ATTENDING THIS PT WERE NOT AWARE IT WAS DONE. CONSEQUENTLY, IT WAS NOT MISSED.
1668916;0;THE ACCOUNT ALLEGES THAT THE BED EXIT WILL ARM, BUT IT WILL NOT ALARM. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED. THE TECH REPLACED THE USER TELEVISION JUNCTION BOX, WHICH RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS AS DESIGNED. PURSUANT TO OUR RESPONSE TO WARNING LETTER 2008-DT-04, HILL-ROM IS CONTINUING ITS RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF EVENTS FOR REPORTABILITY. THIS EFFORT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE ARE CURRENT.
1669226;1;OXYCODONE 5MG UD TABLETS WERE TAKEN FROM THE PYXIS MEDSTATION. WE BELIEVE IT IS A FAULTY DESIGN THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OCCURRENCE.ORAL MEDICATIONS PLACED IN THE FRONT POCKET OF AN I-18 DRAWER (PYXIS MEDSTATION) CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT OPENING THE DRAWER.  THE DRAWER HAS NO LIP OR PROTECTIVE PIECE TO PREVENT REMOVAL OF A MEDICATION.  AN OPENING CAN BE SEEN BY PULLING BACK ON THE DRAWER. A SHARP OBJECT LIKE A PAPERCLIP CAN BE INSERTED TO REMOVE A MEDICATION.
1669413;1;"PT WITH HEART ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS NEEDED HEART MEDICATIONS. ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE ORDERS ON THE CPOE SYSTEM WERE MET WITH A MESSAGE: ""ANOTHER USER IS CURRENTLY MANIPULATING ORDERS ON THIS PATIENT...."". CRITICAL MEDICATION ORDERS WERE DELAYED AND PROFESSIONAL TIME WAS WASTED. IMPACT ON OTHER WORK FLOW WAS SIGNIFICANT. THE PROBLEM OF INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CPOE SYSTEM TO THE ORDERING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL WHEN ANOTHER SERVICE, COMMONLY PHARMACY, HAS OPENED THE PTS' PROFILES REPRESENTS A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO THE PT, IF FOR OTHER REASON THAT IT DELAYS CARE. CARE IS SUBSEQUENTLY DELAYED AND DISRUPTED TO OTHER PTS DUE TO PRIMARY DYSFUNCTION OF THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS FLAW IN THE EQUIPMENT IS COMMON."
1669414;1;MISIDENTIFICATION PROBLEM. PERSON WITH SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT BIRTH DATE AS THE TRUE PT WAS CLICKED AT POINT OF ENTRY AS THE PT. ALL ID PAPERS AND EMR POWERCHART ENTRIES IDENTIFIED THIS PERSON AS THE -INCORRECT- PT. WHEN THE PT ARRIVED TO THE ASSIGNED ROOM, THE ERROR WAS IDENTIFIED, BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTY ACCESSING RECENTLY OBTAINED DATA ON THE ACTUAL PT. NOTHING WAS THERE. THE FREQUENCY OF MISIDENTIFICATION PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH EMR AND CPOE ARE UNK BUT ARE NOT UNCOMMON. DESIGN, FUNCTIONALITY, AND USABILITY OF THE CPOE AND EMR EQUIPMENT ARE SUSPECT AS ETIOLOGY OF THE MISIDENTIFICATION PROBLEM-S.
1669415;1;THE PRECISION OF THE CPOE SYSTEM AT THIS INSTITUTION CONTAINS DEFECTS RENDERING IT IMPRECISE AND INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT. MEDICATIONS ARE INDIVIDUALIZED TO MEET THE GOALS OF THERAPY OF THE INDIVIDUAL PTS. IN THIS CASE, A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE WAS ORDERED AT ONE DOSE FOR THE MORNING AND ANOTHER DOSE FOR THE EVENING AND WERE LISTED AS SUCH ON THE DOCTOR'S SCREEN OF MEDICATIONS BEING GIVEN. ON THE NURSE'S SCREEN OF THE EMAR, BOTH DOSES WERE SCHEDULED TO BE GIVEN AT 9 AM. MEDICATIONS TO BE GIVEN DAILY AT 8PM ARE SCHEDULED AT THE SAME TIME AS DAILY AT 9 AM ON THE NURSE'S EMAR SCREEN. THESE MEDICATIONS GOT TO THE PT'S LIPS BUT NOT THE GULLET, HAVING BEEN STOPPED BY A PHYSICIAN. THE MISS SCHEDULING OF MEDICATIONS IS COMMONPLACE WITH THIS SYSTEM AND REQUIRES VIGILANCE TO KEEP THE ERRORS CAUSED BY THE CPOE SYSTEMS FROM GETTING TO THE PT.
1669416;1;AFTER ORDERS ARE ENTERED ELECTRONICALLY, THEY PASS THROUGH INTERFACES ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR INTENDED TARGET. SUCH TARGETS CONSIST OF NURSES, LABORATORIES, RADIOLOGY SECTIONS, AND PATHOLOGY DEPTS, TO NAME A FEW. A TRANSPORTATION ORDER WAS SPECIFIED FOR THE PT TO TRAVEL WITH A MONITOR BECAUSE OF THE HEART RISK. THE PT TRAVELLED TO AT LEAST ONE TEST WITHOUT A MONITOR. WHETHER THE ORDER ARRIVED AT THE TARGET-S AT ALL WAS AN ISSUE AND REPORTED NEGATIVE BY THE NURSE, IN THIS CASE. THE EXACT INCIDENCE OF ORDER FAILURES EITHER DUE TO FAILURE TO ARRIVE AT THE INTENDED TARGET, OR MISREADS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUMINOUS VERBIAGE ASSOCIATED WITH A SIMPLE ORDER, OR OTHER THOUGHT DISRUPTION IS UNK, BUT CONTINUES WITH ELEVATED FREQUENCY. PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN DO NOT GET PROCESSED AS ORDERED, NURSING ORDERS ARE NOT CARRIED OUT, AND MEDICATIONS ARE NOT GIVEN ARE REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES. NOT ANY RECORD IS BEING KEPT OF ORDER PROBLEMS AS RECOGNIZED BY THE NURSES AND PHYSICIANS. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE EXTENSIVE. WITH A FOCUS ON GETTING THE CARE TO THE PT, INDIVIDUAL REPORTS OF SUCH INCIDENTS ARE ABSENT.

1676620;0;(B)(4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE EVALUATION DID NOT CONFIRM ANY FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE DEVICE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS IIPV DISCOVERED DURING EVALUATION. BASED ON A REVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE THERAPY LOG DATA, THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE IIPV WAS DETERMINED TO BE ONE OR MORE CYCLES ADVANCED TO THE NEXT FILL WHEN SLOW OR NO FLOW OCCURRED ABOVE THE MINIMUM DRAIN VOLUME THRESHOLD. THE DEVICE WILL BE ROUTED TO THE SERVICE AREA. DURING EVALUATION OF A RETURNED HOMECHOICE MACHINE, AN INCREASED INTRA-PERITONEAL VOLUME (IIPV) EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED WHICH OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2010 DURING DRAIN CYCLE 2. THE PATIENT'S DRAIN VOLUME WAS 3928ML. THE LARGEST PRESCRIBED FILL VOLUME WAS 2300ML, THIS MEETS IIPV CRITERIA. NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. SHOULD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE A FOLLOW UP MEDWATCH WILL BE SUBMITTED.
1676935;0;A REPORT WAS RECEIVED THAT THE PATIENT HAD A POCKET REVISION DUE TO POCKET SITE DISCOMFORT. THE POCKET SITE WAS RELOCATED AND A LEAD EXTENSION WAS IMPLANTED. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT.
1677347;0;IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT DURING THE LEAD REVISION, THE DEVICE WAS NOT SENSING, HAD A HIGH CAPTURE THRESHOLD OF GREATER THAN 3.0 V AND LEAD IMPEDANCE WAS 1800 OHMS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE LEAD DISLODGED.  THE LEAD WAS EXPLANTED AND REPLACED. FINAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE REASON FOR RETURN. THESE FAILURES OCCURRED DUE TO THE RING ELECTRODE BEING COVERED BY THE PROXIMAL INSULATION. ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER, NO MEDWATCH FORM WAS RECEIVED.DEVICE EVALUATION ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET BEGUN.
1677426;0;"PT S/P CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY AND STENT PLACEMENT ON (B) (6) 2010. POST PROCEDURE, RIGHT GROIN SHEATH WAS REMOVED, FOLLOWED BY WITH A HEMCON PATCH AND MANUAL PRESSURE.

UPON INSPECTION OF RIGHT GROIN, LARGE HEMATOMA, ""PAINFUL TO TOUCH"" WAS NOTED. THE PT WAS POSITIONED IN TRENDELENBURG FOR BP CONTROL AND MANUAL PRESSURE WAS RE-APPLIED TO RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY GROIN UNTIL BLEEDING SUBSIDED. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON (B) (6) 2010 WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PULSE GENERATOR EXHIBITED PREMATURE BATTERY DEPLETION.  THE DEVICE WAS REPLACED. ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER, NO MEDWATCH FORM WAS RECEIVED. DEVICE EVALUATION ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET BEGUN"
1678004;1;A SUPERDIMENSION REP WENT TO THE SITE TO EVALUATE THE SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM FUNCTION WAS NORMAL. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PT SENSOR TRIPLET WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SENSING VOLUME. CURRENT LABELING STATES: THE PT SENSOR'S SENSING VOLUME IS A VOLUME ABOVE THE LOCATION BOARD IN WHICH THE PT SENSORS WILL PERFORM PROPERLY. WHEN ONE OR MORE OF THE PT SENSORS ARE OUTSIDE THIS VOLUME, AN ON-SCREEN ALERT APPEARS, AND THE PT SENSOR ACCURACY IS NOT GUARANTEED. IN SUCH A CASE, PT SETUP CANNOT BE COMPLETED AND THE SYSTEM WILL DISABLE THE NAVIGATION FUNCTIONS. THE WORKING VOLUME FOR THE PT SENSORS START AT 50MM FROM THE LOCATION BOARD'S SURFACE AND EXTENDS UP TO 380MM. THE CASE WAS NOT COMPLETED WITH THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM WITH THE PT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT, BUT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION WE ARE FILING THIS MDR BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PROCEDURE, THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM WAS UNABLE TO REGISTER THE PT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE REPLACED VARIOUS CABLES AND THE LOCATABLE GUIDE, HOWEVER, THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE SUPERDIMENSION PORTION OF THE CASE WAS ABORTED AND SITE USED OTHER METHODS TO COMPLETE THE CASE.
1678142;0;NO PRODUCT WILL BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. ON (B) (6) 2010, THE PATIENT REPORTED HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE HAS BEEN OUT OF CONTROL FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS WITH HIS READINGS RANGING FROM 200-360 MG/DL. HIS TARGET RANGE IS 120-140 MG/DL. HE STATED HIS READING THIS MORNING WAS 335 MG/DL AND HE DELIVERED INSULIN VIA INJECTION. HIS  READING HAD INCREASED TO 354 MG/DL 17 MINUTES LATER AND HE DELIVERED 6 UNITS OF INSULIN VIA HIS INFUSION DEVICE. HE ATE CEREAL, A BANANA, AND MILK AND 3 HOURS LATER HIS READING WAS 300 MG/DL. HE SAID HE PRIMED HIS INFUSION DEVICE TO TROUBLESHOOT THIS MORNING AND INSULIN EMERGED FROM THE TUBING. HE IS UNSURE IF HIS DEVICE ADAPTER HAS BEEN CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR. HE WAS ADVISED TO CHANGE THE ADAPTER EVERY 10TH CARTRIDGE CHANGE. COURTESY ADAPTERS WERE SENT. HE STATED HE NOTICES AIR BUBBLES AFTER CHANGING THE ADAPTER AND WHILE PRIMING BUT HE IS ABLE TO PRIME THEM OUT. HE DOES NOT ALWAYS ALLOW INSULIN TO REACH ROOM TEMPERATURE PRIOR TO FILLING THE CARTRIDGE. HE WAS ADVISED TO DO SO. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT FIND ANY PRODUCT ISSUES. HE SAID HE HAS RECENTLY BEGUN TAKING NEW MEDICATIONS. HE WAS ADVISED TO SWITCH TO HIS BACKUP INFUSION DEVICE FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PURPOSES. ON FOLLOW UP WITH THE PATIENT ON (B) (6) 2010, HE STATED HE SWITCHED TO HIS BACKUP DEVICE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND HE HAS HAD SEVERAL ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE READINGS WHILE USING IT. THE PATIENT DID NOT REQUIRE ASSISTANCE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OR SECOND PARTY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. NO PRODUCT WILL BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION.
1678227;1;IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, THE FUSION OF THE IMAGE SETS IN QUESTION HAVE BEEN CORRECT. THERE WAS NO RISK OF INJURY FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. DESPITE THIS, THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER HOSPITAL, A RISK TO PATIENT HEALTH COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED. BRAINLAB'S INVESTIGATION HAS SHOWN THAT THE DIGITAL LIGHTBOX 2.0 SOFTWARE PRESUMES IMAGE SETS CONTAINING THE SAME FRAME-OF-REFERENCE ID (= IDENTICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM) BY THE SCANNER TO BE PRE-FUSED BY THE SCANNER, AND THUS DOES NOT REQUEST A REVIEW. NEVERTHELESS, THE SAME FRAME-OF-REFERENCE ID ASSIGNED BY THE IMAGING DEVICE DOES NOT ALWAYS ENSURE THAT THE PATIENT POSITION IN THE ACQUIRED IMAGES ARE IDENTICAL. THIS COULD SUBSEQUENTLY RESULT IN AN INACCURATE NAVIGATION IF NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE USER. BRAINLAB INTENDS THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS RECEIVE A PRODUCT NOTIFICATION INFORMATION. POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT WILL REQUIRE THE USER TO ACTIVELY REVIEW AND CONFIRM THE CORRECT IMAGE FUSION FOR ALL IMAGE SETS. TENTATIVELY PLANNED AVAILABILITY: (B)(6) 2010. BRAINLAB WILL ACTIVELY CONTACT POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CUSTOMERS TO IMPLEMENT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE UPON AVAILABILITY. THE BRAINLAB DIGITAL LIGHTBOX 2.0 IMPORTED SEVERAL DATA SETS FROM THE IMAGING DEVICE. THE USER DETECTED SPECIFIC IMAGE SETS TO BE FUSED WITHOUT THE BRAINLAB SOFTWARE REQUESTING ANY REVIEW BY THE USER. IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, THE FUSION OF THE IMAGE SETS IN QUESTION HAVE BEEN CORRECT.
1678317;0;"THE DEVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED; HOWEVER THE EVALUATION HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED. UPON COMPLETION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED.

DURING PREPARATION, IT WAS NOTICED THE STENT WAS SQUASHED. ANOTHER RAPID EXCHANGE BILIARY STENT SYSTEM WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE WITH NO REPORTED PATIENT COMPLICATIONS. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER THE PROCEDURE. IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION THAT A RAPID EXCHANGE BILIARY STENT SYSTEM WAS USED DURING A STENTING PROCEDURE IN THE BILE DUCT OF A PATIENT (PATIENT AGE, SEX, AND WEIGHT ARE UNKNOWN). DURING PREPARATION, IT WAS NOTICED THE STENT WAS SQUASHED. ANOTHER RAPID EXCHANGE BILIARY STENT SYSTEM WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE WITH NO REPORTED PATIENT COMPLICATIONS. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER THE PROCEDURE. A VISUAL EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE REVEALED THERE WAS NO VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE DISTAL TIP OF THE STENT WAS SMASHED/COLLAPSED AND THE WORKING LENGTH WAS KINKED/BENT LIKELY DUE TO THE SHIPPING/HANDLING OF THE DEVICE. A FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION REVEALED THE STENT COULD BE LOADED BY FORCING THE GUIDE CATHETER THROUGH THE SMASHED/COLLAPSED TIP OF THE STENT. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THIS DEVICE, THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS COMPLAINT IS HANDLING DAMAGE. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) WAS PERFORMED; NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. A SEARCH OF THE COMPLAINT DATABASE REVEALED THAT NO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS EXIST FOR THE SPECIFIED LOT."
1679234;0;DURING AN UPPER ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE, THE PHYSICIAN USED COOK ENDOSCOPY CAPTURA SERRATED FORCEPS WITH SPIKE. THE FORCEPS REPORTEDLY CREATED TEARING OF THE TISSUE INSTEAD OF CLEANLY EXCISING THE TISSUE. A FOREIGN OBJECT DID NOT HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED FROM THE PATIENT. NO ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PROCEDURES WERE REQUIRED DUE TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE PATIENT DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS DUE TO THIS OBSERVATION. THIS REPORT WAS DETERMINED TO BE MDR REPORTABLE UPON RECEIVING THE INFORMATION FROM THE INITIAL REPORTER. COOK ENDOSCOPY REQUESTED AUTHORIZATION TO PARTICIPATE IN FDA'S ALTERNATIVE SUMMARY REPORTING PROGRAM ON (B)(4) 2010. BECAUSE THE DUE DATE OF THIS MDR REPORT FELL BETWEEN (B)(4) 2010 - (B)(4) 2010, THE INFORMATION WAS LISTED IN COOK ENDOSCOPY'S DRAFT ALTERNATIVE SUMMARY REPORT TO BE SUBMITTED TO FDA ON (B)(4) 2010. ON (B)(4) 2010, FDA WAS CONTACTED BY COOK ENDOSCOPY TO INQUIRE AS TO THE STATUS OF AUTHORIZATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ASR PROGRAM. FDA CONTACTED COOK ENDOSCOPY ON (B)(4) 2010 AND INFORMED US THAT OUR REQUEST TO PARTICIPATE HAD BEEN DECLINED BECAUSE THE RATE OF THESE REPORTS IS BELOW THE MINIMUM FOR PARTICIPANT CONSIDERATION. THEREFORE, THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED ON THE INDIVIDUAL MEDWATCH FORM - 3500A. EVALUATION: WE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE REPORT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WAS NOT RETURNED TO COOK ENDOSCOPY FOR EVALUATION. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THE LOT NUMBER SAID TO BE INVOLVED, WE CAN REPORT NO DISCREPANCIES OR ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. WE WERE UNABLE TO CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THIS LOT BECAUSE NONE OF THE PRODUCT FROM THIS LOT REMAINED IN FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY. A REVIEW OF THE TWELVE MONTH COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS RARE. CONCLUSIONS: WE COULD NOT CONDUCT A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED OBSERVATION COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE SIZE OF TISSUE SAMPLE OR BIOPSY TO BE EXCISED CAN BE CONTROLLED BY HOW THE USER HANDLES THE FORCEPS. IF EXCESSIVE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED DURING ADVANCEMENT INTO THE TISSUE OR DURING HANDLE MANIPULATION, THIS COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED OBSERVATION. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE DIRECT THE USER TO ADVANCE THE FORCEPS INTO THE TISSUE AT THE DESIRED BIOPSY SITE. THEN THE USER IS INSTRUCTED TO CLOSE THE FORCEPS AROUND THE TISSUE WHILE USING SLIGHT PRESSURE ON THE HANDLE. THE USER IS INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN GENTLE HANDLE PRESSURE TO KEEP THE CUPS CLOSED AND GENTLY WITHDRAW THE FORCEPS FROM THE SITE. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL CAPTURA SERRATED FORCEPS WITH SPIKE ARE SUBJECTED TO A VISUAL INSPECTION AND FUNCTIONAL TEST TO ENSURE DEVICE INTEGRITY. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD CONFIRMED THAT THE LOT SAID TO BE INVOLVED MET ALL MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. CORRECTIVE ACTION: THE APPROPRIATE INTERNAL PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE AND THIS WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE QUALITY REVIEW BOARD (QRB). NO FURTHER ACTION WARRANTED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE REPORTED OCCURRENCE COULD NOT BE VERIFIED. THE COMPLAINT RISK PRIORITY NUMBER (CRPN) FOR THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAS BEEN CALCULATED BASED ON THE RATE OF OCCURRENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTCOME. BASED ON THIS ACTIVITY, NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS RARE, CUSTOMER QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS.

1693887;0;APPROXIMATELY FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE COIL EMBOLIZATION OF A POSTERIOR BASILAR ANEURYSM, THE PATIENT UNDER WENT A SECOND PROCEDURE TO TREAT THE REOCCURRENCE OF THE ANEURYSM. THERE WERE NO REPORTED CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES. NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. PMA# OR 510K#: K050700 AND K031168. ANTICIPATED PROCEDURAL COMPLICATION. THE DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED SO WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS ANY DEVICE MALFUNCTION, NONCONFORMANCE OR MISUSE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. A REVIEW OF THE LABELING FOUND THAT THE DIRECTIONS FOR USE NOTES THAT MULTIPLE PROCEDURES MAY BE REQUIRED TO OCCLUDE AN ANEURYSM. THEREFORE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE REPORTED EVENT WAS AN ANTICIPATED PROCEDURAL COMPLICATION.
1694749;1;"IT WAS REPORTED BY THE USER THAT THE CLINIC WAS HAVING ISSUE WITH THEIR SCOUT LINES AND LUMBAR POSITIONING. BASICALLY WHEN THEY VIEW THE IMAGES THEY ARE WRONG, BUT WHEN THEY BURN THEM TO A CD, THEY ARE CORRECT. THIS DEVICE WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY, WE WERE ABLE TO LOGIN TO THE CUSTOMER DATABASE. THIS IS SOFTWARE PRODUCT, NOT SINGE USE DEVICE. EVAL SUMMARY (B)(4): ON (B)(6) 2010, A CLINICAL ADMINISTRATOR OF (B)(6) JOINT AND SPINE CLINIC BROUGHT UP A SITUATION TO STRYKER TECH SUPPORT (B)(4) WHO WAS VISITING THE SITE WHERE THEY ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THEIR SCOUT LINES ON LUMBAR MRI STUDIES. A LUMBAR TYPE OF AN MRI STUDY RELATES TO THE SPINE IN THE AREA OF THE BACK BETWEEN THE RIBS AND THE HIP BONES AND IT INCLUDES THE 5 LUMBAR VERTEBRAE FROM L1 TO L5. BASICALLY WHEN THEY VIEW THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS (IMAGINARY VERTICAL PLANE SEPARATING THE BODY INTO LEFT AND RIGHT HALVES OF THE LUMBAR MRI STUDY IN THE OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT) THEY ARE INCORRECTLY POSITIONED AS REFERENCED BY THE CORRESPONDING AXIAL SLICE VIEWS; THIS MEANS LOOKING AT THE BODY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM OF THE ANATOMICAL REGION REPRESENTED BY THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY BURN THE STUDY (OF THE LUMBAR MRI IMAGES) TO A CD, THE SCOUT LINES APPEAR CORRECT. ON (B)(6) 2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY TESTING A SAMPLE MRI STUDY FROM THE CLINIC. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CALCULATION WHICH PLACES THE SCOUT LINES ON THE SAGGITAL VIEWS OF THE MRI IMAGES AS REPRESENTED BY THE CORRESPONDING AXIAL SLICE VIEWS OF THE SAME MRI IMAGES WAS SHIFTED BY A GIVEN BUT UNK MARGIN OF ERROR. THIS RESULTED IN THE ERROR WHERE THE SCOUT LIENS WERE ACTUALLY REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT ANATOMICAL AREA THAN WHAT THE AXIAL VIEWS WERE SHOWING. MORE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE CALCULATION ERROR WAS RELATED TO AN INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT EITHER INITIALLY (ON SITE SINCE THE CLINIC WAS ON OFFICEPACS 3.4 AND WAS UPGRADED ON SITE TO POWER) OR WHILE UPGRADING TO A LATER VERSION OF POWER. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED AN UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT ON THE CLIENT. THE CALCULATION OF THE SCOUT LINES POSITIONING TAKES PLACE ON THE CLIENT AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE ""(B)(6)"" FRAMEWORK INSTALLED ON THE CLIENT LOCALLY. WHEN EXPORTING THE MRI STUDY TO A CD, THE SCOUT LINE ISSUE WAS NOT PRESENT. THE CALCULATION USES A DIFFERENT MECHANISM WHICH USES LEADTOOLS. THIS IS UNAFFECTED BY (B)(6) OR THE LOCAL CLIENT ENVIRONMENT AND ARE INSTEAD PULLED FROM THE SERVER AND PLACED ON THE CD VIEWER WHICH HANDLES THE CALCULATION CORRECTLY. THIS INDICATES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE STUDY ITSELF WAS NOT FAILING AND THAT THE CLIENT'S ENVIRONMENT WAS THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING CAUSE TO THE ERROR IN THE SCOUT LINES CALCULATION. THE ISSUE ON THE ORIGINAL CLIENT APPEARS TO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN PROPAGATED TO OTHER CLIENTS. THE CLINIC'S PERSONNEL UNKNOWINGLY REPLICATED THE CORRUPTED ENVIRONMENT BY TAKING AN ""IMAGE FILE"" OF THE ORIGINAL CLIENT AND REPRODUCING IT TO THE REST OF THE CLIENTS BY IMAGING THEM WITH THE IMAGE OF THE CORRUPTED CLIENT. IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS POINT EXACTLY WHEN THE ISSUES WAS FIRST KNOWN. ACCORDING TO THE CLINICAL ADMINISTRATOR, THE DOCTOR KNEW OF THE ISSUE AND FACTORED IN THE ERROR OF THE SCOUT LINES WHEN BEFORE ANY PROCEDURES. HE FURTHER EXPRESSED THE CONCERN THAT DEPENDING ON THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF THE SCOUT LINES CALCULATION, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A PHYSICIAN WILL NOT REALIZE THAT ERROR AND MAY POTENTIALLY OPERATE ON THE WRONG ANATOMICAL REGION. THE CLINIC HAS NOT REPORTED ANY PT HARM TO DATE, HOWEVER, THEY EXPRESSED THE CONCERN OF HAZARD AND POTENTIAL HARM. AS OF 4/30/2010, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY REINSTALLING THE (B)(6) FRAMEWORK ON THE CLIENT, AS WELL AS THE OFFICEPACS POWER CLIENT SOFTWARE AN ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS/WORKSTATIONS. THE ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED AT OTHER SITES, AND IT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN HOUSE."

1696541;1;RECEIVED REPORT THAT PT IN XIRIS HAS THREE ASSOCIATED EXAMS, BUT SAME PT IN ISITE PACS HAS MULTIPLE ASSOCIATED EXAMS FROM DIFFERENT PTS. ISITE PACS IS A SOFTWARE PRODUCT. WE ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE PRODUCT AT THE CUSTOMER SITE BY REMOTE ACCESS, AS WELL AS EVALUATE THE SAME PRODUCT VERSION IN-HOUSE. WORKING WITH XIRIS TO INVESTIGATE THIS OCCURRENCE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WHEN XIRIS IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRED, THE MANUAL HL7 MAPPING OF PT ID FROM XIRIS TO ISITE PACS WAS DONE ERRONEOUSLY. INSTEAD OF MAPPING THE UNIQUE PT ID FIELD IN XIRIS (PAT NUMBER) TO UNIQUE PT ID FIELD IN ISITE PACS (MRN), A NON-UNIQUE XIRIS FIELD (PAT ALT NUMBER) WAS MAPPED IN ERROR. ALL EXAMS WITH THE PAT ALT NUMBER WERE THEN ASSOCIATED TO THE ONE PT IN ISITE PACS FOR WHICH THE PAT ALT NUMBER WAS MAPPED. XIRIS HAS CORRECTED THE MAPPING FOR THIS CUSTOMER, AND ALL AFFECTED DATA HAS BEEN CORRECTED/RESTORED. NEITHER ISITE PACS NOR XIRIS MALFUNCTIONED. BOTH PRODUCTS ARE WORKING AS DESIGNED.

INITIALLY, A HARD RESET WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT NOW THE HARD RESET IS NOT HELPING. THE PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO THE MFR AND UNDERWENT ANALYSIS. UPON ANALYSIS, A BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION NEAR THE MAIN BATTERY TERMINAL WAS IDENTIFIED. THE BROKEN SOLDER CONNECTION CAN PREVENT THE MAIN BATTERY FROM MAKING GOOD ELECTRICAL CONTACT WITH THE PCB. THIS CONDITION CAN CAUSE THE HANDHELD TO INTERMITTENTLY LOSE POWER WHILE THE DEVICE IS OPERATING ON MAIN BATTERY POWER. ALSO DURING THE ANALYSIS, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE USER WAS INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM A HARD RESET BY REMOVING THE MAIN BATTERY FOR 30 SECONDS. ACCORDING TO THE (B)(6) USER MANUAL, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO REMOVE THE MAIN BATTERY FOR 5 MINUTES IN ORDER TO PERFORM A HARD RESET. THIS EVENT ALSO COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT.

CUSTOMER REPORTED A PATIENT MEDICATION ERROR, RESULTING FROM A CLINICIAN'S CONFUSION AND INCORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE MEDICATION ORDER WITHIN THE MEDICATION SERVICES DISPLAY OF PICIS' ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION. ALTHOUGH THE ORDER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPLAYED FOR INSULIN 100UNITS/ML SOLUTION - DOSE: 10 UNIT(S) IV, THE ERROR RESULTED WITH A PATIENT RECEIVING A DOSE OF INSULIN, 100 UNITS IV. THE CUSTOMER EXPLAINED THAT THE CLINICIAN THOUGHT THE DOSE SEEMED 'HIGH', BUT ALSO WORKS IN AN ICU WHERE SUCH A DOSE, WHILE VERY RARE, OCCASIONALLY OCCURS. FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF THE ORDER, THE CLINICIAN WENT BACK TO THE MEDICATION SERVICES SCREEN TO REVIEW THE ORDER AND DOCUMENT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEDICATION, AND AT THAT POINT THEY REALIZED THE MISTAKE. THE PATIENT HAD NO IMMEDIATE OR LONG TERM EFFECTS. THE PATIENT WAS GIVEN LUNCH AND MONITORED THROUGH FINGER STICKS TO MEASURE BLOOD SUGAR. BLOOD SUGAR NEVER WENT BELOW 200 AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE ED ABOUT 4 HOURS LATER."

1703133;0;ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY ON-GOING. UPON COMPLETION OF ANALYSIS THIS REPORT WILL BE UPDATED. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED AT OUR POST MARKET QUALITY ASSURANCE LABORATORY. PORTIONS OF THE CIRCUITRY, INCLUDING THE BATTERY, WERE ISOLATED AND TESTED. FINAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THIS DEVICE HAD A COMPROMISED LOW VOLTAGE CAPACITOR THAT DID NOT MEET DESIGN SPECIFICATION. DESPITE THIS COMPROMISED CAPACITOR, CURRENT LEAKAGE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADVERSELY IMPACT DEVICE LONGEVITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEMORY LOG WAS REVIEWED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THIS DEVICE DID NOT CAPTURE R-WAVE SIGNALS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DEVICE'S VENTRICULAR SENSITIVITY PARAMETER WAS SET AT LEAST SENSITIVITY. FROM THERE, THE LABORATORY TECHNICIAN CHANGED THE DEVICE'S SETTING TO NOMINAL AND THE DEVICE STARTED SENSING APPROPRIATELY. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE WAS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING BOTH BRADY AND TACHY THERAPIES AS PROGRAMMED. NORMAL PACING, SENSING, AND DEFIBRILLATION THERAPY FUNCTIONS WERE VERIFIED DURING TESTING. HENCE, THE FAILURE OF THE DEVICE TO SENSE R-WAVE WHILE IT WAS IMPLANTED COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO IMPROPER SETUP OF THE SENSITIVITY PARAMETER. BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THIS IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR (ICD) WAS EXHIBITING OVERSENSING ON THE RIGHT VENTRICULAR (RV) CHANNEL. NO ASYSTOLE GREATER THAN 2 SECONDS WAS OBSERVED/REPORTED AND THERE WERE NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS. THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED, REPLACED AND RETURNED FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS.

THE BOSTON SCIENTIFIC SALES REPRESENTATIVE REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE CLINIC FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. AT THIS TIME, NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS WERE REPORTED. IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT AT CHANGEOUT THEY HAD DECIDED TO ONLY USE THE DISTAL COIL OF THIS LEAD AND THEY SURGICALLY ABANDONED THE PROXIMAL DF-1 PIN DUE TO HIGH IMPEDANCE. THEY ARE NOW USING A SINGLE COIL SYSTEM. SHOCK IMPEDANCE HAS RANGED FROM 90 OHMS AT IMPLANT TO THE 120'S OHMS RANGE. IMPEDANCE CURRENTLY IS 111 OHMS. THE REPRESENTATIVE INQUIRED IF DEFIBRILLATION THRESHOLD (DFT) TESTING SHOULD BE PERFORMED TO TEST THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF NOISE OR OVERSENSING. THEY WILL PERFORM DFT'S TO CHECK SYSTEM INTEGRITY. -- IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE QUESTIONED THE RISING SHOCK IMPEDANCE AT THE GENERATOR CHANGE OUT. IMPEDANCE WAS 88 OHMS. WHEN TESTED WITH THE PACING SYSTEM ANALYZER, PACE IMPEDANCE WAS GREATER THAN 3000 OHMS WITH THE PROXIMAL COIL. PACE IMPEDANCE WAS WITHIN RANGE WITH THE DISTAL COIL. THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN IMPLANTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND THE PHYSICIAN SUSPECTED THE PROXIMAL COIL MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED AS IT WAS PLACED NEAR THE SHOULDER. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED TO PLUG THE PROXIMAL PORT. ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE LEAD REMAINS IN SERVICE. THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THE EVENT WILL BE UPDATED. IT WAS LATER REPORTED THAT SHOCK IMPEDANCE HAD RISEN TO >125 OHMS. TS RECOMMENDED BRINGING THE PATIENT IN FOR EVALUATION. TS DISCUSSED TROUBLESHOOTING OPTIONS. NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE LEAD REMAINS IN SERVICE. THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, THE EVENT WILL BE UPDATED. BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THIS RIGHT VENTRICULAR (RV) DEFIBRILLATION LEAD DISPLAYED FLUCTUATING SHOCK IMPEDANCE. A RED ALERT WAS ISSUED INDICATING SHOCK IMPEDANCE WAS HIGH. IMPEDANCE HAD NOT GONE OUT OF RANGE. NO NOISE WAS SEEN. TECHNICAL SERVICES DISCUSSED TESTING LEAD INTEGRITY WITH A HIGH ENERGY SHOCK AND GETTING AN X-RAY. THE CLINICIAN INDICATED THEY WOULD PROBABLY JUST MONITOR THE PATIENT MONTHLY VIA LATITUDE AND ROUTINE FOLLOW UP. NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. --
1703738;0;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CRM RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THIS RIGHT VENTRICULAR (RV) LEAD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A REPORT OF A REMOTE MONITORING ALERT FOR A LOW SHOCK IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT. A BOSTON SCIENTIFIC FIELD REPRESENTATIVE SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED OTHER LEAD MEASUREMENTS WERE NORMAL AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF OVERSENSING. THE SHOCK IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS HAD BEEN NORMAL AND STABLE, THEN BEGAN FLUCTUATING AND DROPPED TO BELOW OUT-OF-SPECIFICATION RANGE OVER A TWO-WEEK PERIOD. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS, AND THE LEAD REMAINED IMPLANTED AND IN SERVICE. THE LEAD SUBSEQUENTLY WAS CAPPED AND SURGICALLY ABANDONED, AND ANOTHER RV DEFIBRILLATION LEAD WAS IMPLANTED WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECTS.
1704034;0;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT THIS ICARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY DEFIBRILLATOR (CRT-D) WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO NORMAL BATTERY DEPLETION.  HOWEVER, INITIAL ANALYSIS REVEALED A DEVICE ANOMALY.  NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS WERE REPORTED. THIS DEVICE IS INCLUDED IN THE SHORTENED REPLACEMENT WINDOW ADVISORY. DETAILED ANALYSIS IS PENDING. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED AT OUR POST MARKET QUALITY ASSURANCE LABORATORY. PORTIONS OF THE CIRCUITRY, INCLUDING THE BATTERY, WERE ISOLATED AND TESTED. FINAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THIS DEVICE HAD A COMPROMISED LOW VOLTAGE CAPACITOR THAT DID NOT MEET DESIGN SPECIFICATION. DESPITE THIS COMPROMISED CAPACITOR, CURRENT LEAKAGE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADVERSELY IMPACT DEVICE LONGEVITY. NORMAL PACING, SENSING, AND DEFIBRILLATION THERAPY FUNCTIONS WERE VERIFIED DURING TESTING.
1705074;0;THE PT CALLED IN REGARDS TO THE RECALL NOTIFICATION. THE INFUSION DEVICE WAS REPLACED AND RETURNED. UPON EVAL, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOTH THE UP AND DOWN BUTTONS OF THE INFUSION DEVICE WERE MALFUNCTIONING. NO PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS WERE REPORTED. THE PT DID NOT REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL OR SECOND PARTY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.
1706590;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PROCEDURE THE SUPERDIMENSION SYS WAS UNABLE TO REGISTER THE PT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SITE COULD NOT GET THE LOCATABLE GUIDE TO SHOW UP AS A GREEN DOT ON THE SCREEN, THEY SWAPPED TO A SECOND LOCATABLE GUIDE AND ENCOUNTERED THE SAME ISSUE. THEY REPLACED THE LOCATABLE GUIDE CABLE WITH NO CHANGE. FINALLY THE THIRD LOCATABLE GUIDE WAS USED AND THIS ONE FLICKERED BETWEEN YELLOW AND GREEN. THE SUPERDIMENSION PORTION OF THE CASE WAS THEN ABORTED WITH THE PT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. A SUPERDIMENSION REP WENT TO THE SITE TO EVALUATE THE SYS AND COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN. THE THREE LOCATABLE GUIDE COMPONENTS WERE RETURNED TO SUPERDIMENSION FOR ANALYSIS. THE ANALYSIS OF ALL THREE LOCATABLE GUIDES SHOWED NORMAL FUNCTION AND NO ABNORMALITIES WERE FOUND. THE SITE PERFORMED TWO SUCCESSFUL CASES ON (B)(4)-2010 AND NO SIMILAR ISSUES WERE ENCOUNTERED. THE CASE WAS NOT COMPLETED WITH THE SUPERDIMENSION SYS WITH THE PT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT, BUT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION WE ARE FILING THIS MDR BECAUSE OF THE ADD'L RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA.
1706610;1;DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER DID NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO TAPS ON THE SCREEN. THE PHYSICIAN HAD TRIED ALIGNING THE SCREEN SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE ISSUE PREVAILS. THE PHYSICIAN REQUESTED A NEW PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. THE REPORTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING PRODUCT ANALYSIS.
1706615;1;A VNS PROGRAMMING PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT THEIR (B)(6) HANDHELD COMPUTER CONTAINING 7.1 PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE HAD A BLANK WHITE SCREEN AND THE TOP PORTION OF THE SCREEN LOOKED LIKE GREY WALLPAPER WITH HORIZONTAL BARS.

THE LEAD WAS NOT IMPLANTED. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.
1707519;0;DEVICE ISSUE: NEEDLE-TO-CUFF MISS, DIFFICULT TO REMOVE, DETACHED SHEATH, DETACHED PORTION OF FOOT. TIME OF DEVICE ISSUE: DURING VESSEL CLOSURE. ADVERSE EVENT: SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO REMOVE FOREIGN BODY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A NURSE TRAINED IN THE USE OF THE PERCLOSE PROGLIDE DEVICE ATTEMPTED ARTERIOTOMY CLOSURE OF A HEAVILY SCARRED COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY AFTER AN INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE. REPORTEDLY, WHEN THE NEEDLE PLUNGER WAS REMOVED, NO SUTURE WAS ATTACHED TO THE NEEDLES. DURING DEVICE REMOVAL, RESISTANCE WAS MET. THE PHYSICIAN CAME OVER TO ASSIST THE NURSE, APPLIED ADDITIONAL FORCE TO REMOVE THE DEVICE AND THE SHEATH DETACHED AT THE DISTAL GUIDE. THE DETACHED SHEATH MIGRATED TO THE PROFUNDA, WHICH WAS SURGICALLY REMOVED. WHEN THE DEVICE WAS REMOVED, IT WAS NOTICED THAT A PORTION OF THE FOOT WAS MISSING. EFFORTS TO LOCATE THE DETACHED PORTION OF THE FOOT WITH ANGIOGRAPHY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PT WAS REPORTED TO BE ASYMPTOMATIC AND WAS DISCHARGED THREE DAYS LATER. THERE WERE NO REPORTED ADVERSE PT SEQUELAE. THOUGH REQUESTED, NO ADDITIONAL INFO WAS PROVIDED. (B) (4). (B) (4). AGAINST RESISTANCE. THE DEVICE IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED FOR EVALUATION.

NO PATIENT INJURIES OR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRED. PATIENT STATUS IS LISTED AS ""STABLE."" PRODUCT ANALYSIS REVEALED STENT DAMAGE. THIS PRODUCT IS ONLY OUS APPROVED BUT IS SIMILAR TO AN APPROVED US DEVICE. DEVICE EVALUATED BY MANUFACTURER - A VISUAL AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION IDENTIFIED STENT DAMAGE. STRUTS ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STENT WERE MISALIGNED. A VISUAL AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION IDENTIFIED KINKS ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE HYPOTUBE. THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE BEING APPLIED TO THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE BALLOON AND TIP SECTIONS OF THE DEVICE WERE VISUALLY AND MICROSCOPICALLY EXAMINED AND NO ISSUES WERE NOTED WITH THEIR PROFILES THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT. THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY WRAPPED AND WAS NOT SUBJECTED TO POSITIVE PRESSURE. SOLIDIFIED CONTRAST MEDIA WAS PRESENT WITHIN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE INFLATION LUMEN, THEREFORE INDICATING THE DEVICE HAD BEEN PREPPED FOR USE. THE MANUFACTURING BATCH RECORD REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE MET ALL MATERIAL, ASSEMBLY AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE CLASSIFICATION IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AS DEVICE PERFORMANCE WAS LIMITED DUE TO ANATOMICAL/PROCEDURAL FACTORS. (B)(4)."

1711538;1;"THE VENCOR PROTOUCH COMPUTERIZED ELECTRONIC CARE RECORD AND ORDERING SYSTEM IS DEPLOYED AT ALL LONG TERM ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. IT IS SAID TO BE A ""HOME GROWN"" SYSTEM WITH EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES HIGHLIGHTED BY ANTIQUATED PLATFORMS. NURSES DESCRIBE CLUNKINESS TO CHART PT APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTION WITH LIMITATION TO ACCURACY. THE EQUIPMENT OFTEN FAILS TO TRANSFER ORDERS AND ASSOCIATED COMMUNICATIONS TO THE RECIPIENT WHETHER THAT BE LABORATORY, CONSULTANTS, NURSES, REHABILITATION, AND NUTRITION, RESULTING IN FAILURE TO EXECUTE ORDERS ACCURATELY, IF AT ALL, AND HAS RESULTED IN CASES IN WHICH ERRONEOUS RECORDS BELONGING TO AN ALTERNATIVE PT ARE ELECTRONICALLY APPENDED TO THE INCORRECT PT. THIS SOFTWARE FAILURE IN THE ELECTRONIC ORDERING SYSTEM POSES RISK TO EACH PT THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF HOSPITALS AND SAID RISK IS INSUFFICIENTLY REDUCED. A LARGELY OVERLOOKED SOURCE OF ERROR OF ALL ELECTRONIC ORDERING SYSTEMS IS THE COMPUTERIZED TRANSFORMATION OF THE ORDER OR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARTIES SUCH THAT THE RECIPIENT GETS THE COMPUTERIZED ALTERED VERSION RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION WITH NEITHER PARTIES SEEING THE SAME SCREEN."
1711596;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S VNS HANDHELD COMPUTER HAD A FROZEN SCREEN AND WOULD NOT MOVE ON FROM THE SCREEN. PRODUCT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER, BUT ANALYSIS IS PENDING.
1711610;1;"IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR PROGRAMMING SYSTEM. WHEN THE ISSUE WAS INITIALLY REPORTED, THE HANDHELD COMPUTER SCREEN SHOWED ""PROCEDURE FAILED."" WHEN THE NURSE PRESSED OK, SHE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE MAIN VNS SOFTWARE SCREEN. IT WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE SITE THAT THE MESSAGE APPEARED TO BE A COMMUNICATION ISSUE. THE WAND BATTERY WAS VERIFIED TO BE SUFFICIENT BY TESTING 9V BATTERY USING RED RESET BUTTONS. THE HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT PLUGGED INTO THE WALL. THE NURSE INDICATED THAT THE ISSUE WAS OCCURRING WITH MULTIPLE PATIENTS WHILE TRYING TO INTERROGATE. THE ADAPTER CABLES WERE SECURE. IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THE NEXT PATIENT WOULD BE IN THE OFFICE TO PERFORM FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING. A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND THE OTHER PROGRAMMING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS AS GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE DEVICE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE."
1711612;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT A PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD DEVICE WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE HANDHELD WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO TURN ON. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT THE SITE PERFORM TROUBLESHOOTING, HOWEVER, THE SITE REFUSED. THE HANDHELD HAD BEEN LEFT ON ALL NIGHT AND HAD NOT BEEN CHARGED. IT WAS EXPLAINED TO THE SITE THAT IF THE DEVICE IS NOT CHARGED, THE BATTERY WILL BECOME DEPLETED CAUSING THE HANDHELD TO GO THROUGH A HARD RESET WHEN IT DOES TURN ON. THE SITE WAS SENT A REPLACEMENT HANDHELD DEVICE AT THEIR REQUEST AND THE HANDHELD IN QUESTION WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANALYSIS. DEVICE EVALUATION HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME.
1711614;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE USER'S HANDHELD WOULD FREEZE UPON INTERROGATIONS. TROUBLE SHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF IT RESOLVED THE ISSUE. THE SITE REQUESTED THAT A NEW DEVICE BE SENT TO REPLACE THE NON-WORKING DEVICE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE NON-WORKING DEVICE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.

1712194;1;THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT A BASIC METABOLIC PANEL (BMP) AND SPECIMEN NUMBER ASSIGNED TO A NEW PT ALREADY BELONGS TO ANOTHER PT. THERE WAS NO REPORTED PT INJURY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. A F/U REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE. (B)(4).
1712584;1;THE SYSTEM WAS USED FOLLOWING THE REPORTED INCIDENT FOR ADDITIONAL CASES WITH NO SIMILAR FAILURES NOTED. IN ADDITION A BWI SERVICE ENGINEER WAS SENT TO THE SITE AND PERFORMED ALL REQUIRED TESTS WHICH RESULTED WITH NO FAILURES IDENTIFIED. THE SYSTEM MEETS ITS SPECIFICATIONS AND IS READY FOR USE. THE MANUFACTURER IS INVESTIGATING THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT ON DEVICE EVALUATION WILL BE SUBMITTED ONCE IT IS COMPLETED. BOTH LASSO AND NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL TC CATHETERS WERE STATED TO BE WORKING PROPERLY. (B)(4). A MILD CARDIAC TAMPONADE OCCURRED DURING AN A-FIB ABLATION PERFORMED AS A STANDARD CARTO 3 PROCEDURE (NON RMT) WITH THE CARTO 3 RMT. THE RMT CHECK BOX WAS UNCHECKED SO THEY WORKED WITH ENLARGED MAPPING ZONE OF STANDARD CARTO 3 PROCEDURE. THE USER PROCEEDED AS USUAL WITH THE INITIALIZATION BUT THEY COULD NOT OBSERVE A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE FLUOROSCOPY AND THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM. FURTHER DETAIL ON THE CARTO 3 SYSTEM SHOWED THAT THE LASSO CATHETER SEEMED TO BE LOCATED HIGHER THAN IN THE FLUOROSCOPY WHEN COMPARED TO THE LOCATION OF THE NAVISTAR. THEY WERE USING A STANDARD LASSO CATHETER (NOT LASSO NAV). THE USER REINITIALIZED THE CPM A COUPLE OF TIMES, DOUBLE CHECKED THAT EVERYTHING WAS CONNECTED PROPERLY BUT THE ISSUE PERSISTED. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY HAD TO SUSPEND THE PROCEDURE DUE TO A TAMPONADE. THE PHYSICIAN STATED THAT THE TAMPONADE DID NOT OCCUR DURING THE TRANSSEPTAL PUNCTURE BUT LATER WHILE MANEUVERING THE CATHETER. IT WAS UNCLEAR IF THE LASSO CATHETER WAS IN THE LEFT OR RIGHT ATRIUM. HOWEVER, IT WAS UNLIKELY TO BE IN THE EPICARDIUM SPACE. NO ABLATION WAS DELIVERED, THE PERFORATION OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEDURE. CARDIAC DRAINAGE WAS PERFORMED. NO SURGERY WAS NEEDED. THE ADVERSE EVENT WAS SAID TO BE POSSIBLY PROCEDURE RELATED. THE PT HAD FULLY RECOVERED. THE PATIENT'S CONDITION ON THE DAY AFTER WAS FINE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE PHYSICIAN, IT APPEARS THAT AN INCORRECT POSITION OF THE LASSO CATHETER WAS DISPLAYED BY THE CARTO SYSTEM. WHEN COMPARING THE FLUOROSCOPY IMAGE TO THE CATHETER VISUALIZATION AS DISPLAYED ON THE CARTO SYSTEM, THE PHYSICIAN NOTED THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CATHETER LOCATION BUT CHOSE TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROCEDURE PER HER OWN DISCRETION. FROM THE PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS, IT APPEARS THAT ONLY THE LASSO CATHETER LOCATION WAS INCORRECT.
1712727;1;ORDER WAS ENTERED ON CPOE FOR NEPHROLOGY CONSULTATION SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER. UPON RECONCILING ORDERS AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEPHROLOGY CONSULTATION WAS NEVER CARRIED OUT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONSULTATION ORDER NEVER ELECTRONICALLY REACHED THE TASK OR NURSE'S SCREEN. IT WAS NEVER CALLED BECAUSE THE NURSE NEVER SAW THE ORDER. THE ORDER REMAINED LISTED ON THE PRIOR ORDER SCREEN OF THE PHYSICIAN. CARE WAS DELAYED. PT AT RISK. NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. INTRINSIC DEFECT IN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DEVICE KEEPS NURSES FROM SEEING EXACTLY WHAT WAS ORDERED.

1713343;0;THE PT REPORTEDLY EXPERIENCED OVERLY LOUD STIMULATION. THE PT'S DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED.
1713653;1;OUR INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE REASON FOR NO ALLERGY INTERACTION NOTIFICATION WAS A RESULT OF RECEIVING CODED ALLERGIES FROM A NON-SUPPORTED EXTERNAL DRUG DATABASE SOURCE. THE ALLERGY DATA IN QUESTION WAS RECEIVED BY PICIS' ED HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION IN 2006. IT IS CUSTOMARY IN HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS FOR ALLERGY INFORMATION TO 'CARRY THROUGH' FROM VISIT TO VISIT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS THAT IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WE CONCLUDED THAT THIS CLIENT IS NO LONGER SENDING NON-SUPPORTED ALLERGY CODES AND HAS NOT DONE SO SINCE LATE 2008. PICIS IS WORKING WITH THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW ALLERGY CODES SENT PRIOR TO 2008 TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL ERRONEOUS ALLERGY CODES STORED IN THE DATABASE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION, WE IDENTIFIED TWO SIMILAR CUSTOMER SITE CONFIGURATIONS WITH NON-SUPPORTED DRUG DATABASES. THERE WERE NO ASSOCIATED PT INCIDENT REPORTS. HOWEVER, WE ARE WORKING WITH THESE CUSTOMERS TO PREVENT UNSUPPORTED ALLERGY CODES FROM BEING SENT TO THE PICIS APPLICATION. PICIS IS ALSO EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL FOR SIMILAR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION ERROR IN OTHER SITES. WE WILL EVALUATE THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION AND IMPLEMENT ACCORDINGLY. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A PT INCIDENT INVOLVING PICIS' ED (EMERGENCY DEPT.) ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION RELATED TO ALLERGY DATA RECEIVED VIA INTERFACE FROM THEIR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEM, WHICH WAS 'CODED' USING A 3RD PARTY DRUG DATABASE TERMINOLOGY NOT SUPPORTED BY PICIS. THE NUMERIC CODE REPRESENTING 'SULFONAMIDES' IN THE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT ALLERGY CONCEPT (METHYLXANTHINES) IN PICIS' SUPPORTED THIRD PARTY DRUG DATABASE. THE SCREEN DISPLAYED THE CORRECT ALLERGY NAME OF SULFONAMIDES TO THE PHYSICIAN, BUT THE BACKGROUND ALLERGY CHECKING LOGIC (DETERMINED BY THE NUMERIC CODE SENT FROM THE INTERFACE) DID NOT NOTIFY THE PHYSICIAN OF A POTENTIAL ALLERGY INTERACTION, WHEN A PRESCRIPTION FOR BACTRIM WAS WRITTEN. THE PT WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE ED WITH THE WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION WHICH WAS LATER FILLED BY A RETAIL PHARMACIST. THE PT MANIFESTED SYMPTOMS OF AN ALLERGIC REACTION WITHIN 24 HOURS, WAS SEEN TWICE BY PHYSICIANS AND SENT HOME WITH OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BUT ULTIMATELY REQUIRED 48 HOURS OF INPATIENT OBSERVATION, BEFORE BEING DISCHARGED HOME WITH NO LONG TERM EFFECTS.
1713716;0;COMPLAINANT ALLEGED THAT DURING BIOMED TESTING, THE DEVICE POWERED ON WITHOUT DISPLAY. COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO PT INVOLVEMENT IN THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION. ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION HAS NOT RECEIVED THE DEVICE FOR EVALUATION AND THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.
1713744;0;THE CUSTOMER CALLED TO REPORT A FROZEN DISPLAY. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED, AND THE DISPLAY REMAINED FROZEN. ADVISED THAT THE INSULIN PUMP WOULD BE REPLACED. NOTHING FURTHER WAS REPORTED. THE INSULIN PUMP HAD A BLANK DISPLAY DUE TO MOISTURE DAMAGE ON THE ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY. UNABLE TO TEST FOR FROZEN SCREEN OR BLACK LINES ON THE DISPLAY DUE TO BLANK DISPLAY.
1714436;0;TERUMO CARDIOVASCULAR WAS INFORMED THAT OUT OF BOX THERE WAS CONCEALED DAMAGE TO THE TUBING PACK. THE EVENT DID NOT RESULT IN DELAY OF THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE. TERUMO DID RECEIVED THE ACTUAL DEVICE FOR EVAL. VISUAL INSPECTION NOTED DAMAGE TO THE OUTER PACKAGING AND THE INNER STERILE BARRIER (B)(4). IT IS UNK WHERE THE DAMAGE OCCURRED, THUS REFERENCE CONCLUSION CODE. A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT FILES CONFIRMED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO PREVIOUS REPORTS FOR THIS LOT. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD DID NOT INDICATE ANY PRODUCTION RELATED PROBLEMS. ALL AVAILABLE INFO HAS BEEN PLACED ON FILE IN QUALITY MGMT FOR APPROPRIATE TRACKING, TRENDING, AND F/U. (B)(4).
1715735;0;"THE HUB ON A PALMAZ GENESIS OPTA PRO STENT WAS NOTED TO BE CRACKED WHEN THE SYRINGE WAS GOING TO BE ATTACHED.  THE PRODUCT WAS NEVER PREPPED OR USED IN THE PATIENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON 30 DAYS OF RECEIPT. THE HUB WAS NOTED TO BE CRACKED WHEN THE SYRINGE WAS GOING TO BE ATTACHED. THE PRODUCT WAS NEVER PREPPED OR USED IN THE PATIENT. A NON-STERILE PALMAZ GENESIS, ON AN OPTA PRO 9MMX39CM, 80 CM WAS RECEIVED COILED AND INSIDE A BAG. THE BALLOON AND THE STENT WERE NOT USED. A CRACK WAS NOTED IN THE INFLATION PORT OF THE LUER HUB. NO OTHER ANOMALY WAS NOTED IN THE RETURNED DEVICE. A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE WAS DONE TO THE HUB AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SURFACES OF THE HUB PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE. MINIMAL CRACKING COULD BE NOTED IN THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THIS PIECE ALONG WITH THE CRAZE THAT WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE WALL THICKNESS OF THE HUB. NO VISUAL EVIDENCE OF ANY CHEMICAL DEGRADATION OR CUTTING IN THE MATERIAL WAS NOTED. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THIS CRACKING COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RECENT COMPLAINT RECEIVED FOR THE CRACKED HUB ON PALMAZ GENESIS, ON OPTA PRO, WAS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO ASSESS CURRENT CONTROLS AND HOW THE ACTUAL PROCESS WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS COMPLAINT. THE SCOPE OF THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDES THE OPTA PRO CA ASSEMBLY AND PALMAZ GENESIS, ON OPTA PRO, STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM LINES. AFTER VISITING THE OPTA PRO PROCESS, THERE WERE NO MATERIALS, TOOLS OR EQUIPMENTS THAT COULD GENERATE THE HUB CRACK. THE REPORTED CRACKED HUB WAS CONFIRMED; HOWEVER, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THESE DAMAGES COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED. NEITHER THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS NOR THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE FAILURES EXPERIENCED BY THE COSTUMER COULD BE RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW A CLINICAL CONCLUSION BETWEEN THE DEVICE AND THE EVENT. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTIVE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN; GIVEN THAT, THE REPORTED FAILURE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS."
1715965;0;"A TALENT STENT GRAFT SYSTEM WAS IMPLANTED IN A PATIENT FOR THE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT OF AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM. VESSEL MORPHOLOGY WAS REPORTED AS MILD TORTUOSITY AND SEVERE CALCIFICATION. THE PATIENT HAD A TOTALLY OCCLUDED LEFT ILLAC ARTERY. THE PATIENT HAS A HISTORY OF SMOKING AND ALCOHOL USE. THE RIGHT ILIAC ARTERY WAS DILATED WITH DILATORS DUE TO THE SEVERE CALCIFICATION. THE PHYSICIAN ELECTED TO PLACE A VIABAHN STENT FROM THE AORTIC BIFURCATION DOWN TO JUST PROXIMAL TO THE HYPOGASTRIC. THEN A SECOND VIABAHN WAS IMPLANTED BELOW THE HYPOGASTRIC ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN HAD DIFFICULTIES ADVANCING THE TALENT CONVERTER TO THE INTENDED LANDING ZONE. THE DEVICE WAS WITHDRAWN AND THE VIABAHN STENTS WERE MODELED WITH AN 8X40 BALLOON AND A 10X40 BALLOON. THE CONVERTER DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS REINSERTED AND SUCCESSFULLY IMPLANTED AT THE INTENDED LANDING ZONE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN THE TALENT CONVERTER DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT, THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED; HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY REMOVING IT. DURING THE MODELING AND STENT GRAFT IMPLANTING, THE PATIENT WAS STABLE WITH NO COMPLICATIONS. THE PHYSICIAN BELIEVES THAT THE HYPOGASTRIC ARTERY WAS TORN AND ELECTED TO PLACE A COVERED STENT BETWEEN THE VIABAHN STENTS BUT THE BLOOD PRESSURE WAS STILL LOW. THE PHYSICIAN FELT THAT THE COVERED STENT THAT WAS PLACED TO REPAIR THE HYPOGASTRIC ARTERY WAS PLACED TOO LOW; THEREFORE, ANOTHER COVERED STENT WAS IMPLANTED. THE ENTIRE ILIAC ARTERY WAS STENTED. THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE WAS STILL UNSTABLE BUT IMPROVED SLIGHTLY; HOWEVER, THE PATIENT WENT INTO VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA. THE GROIN WAS PARTIALLY SURGICALLY OPENED, AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THE HYPOGASTRIC ARTERY WAS SEVERED FROM THE ILIAC ARTERY. THE PATIENT WAS OPENED FURTHER IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING. THERE WAS RETROGRADE BLEEDING FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT AND THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING. THE PATIENT EXPIRED DURING AN ATTEMPT TO REPAIR THE BLEEDING. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. (B) (4). EVALUATION RESULTS: DEATH, ARTERIAL TRAUMA/DISSECTION/PERFORATION; CHRONICALLY TOTALLY OCCLUDED LEFT ILLAC ARTERY, HISTORY OF SMOKING; CONVERTER USED AS THE MAIN DEVICE. CONCLUSIONS: CHRONICALLY TOTALLY OCCLUDED LEFT ILLAC ARTERY, HISTORY OF SMOKING; CONVERTER USED AS THE MAIN DEVICE."
1716131;0;THE DEVICE WAS REPLACED DUE TO DECREASED BATTERY VOLTAGE FOLLOWING THE DELIVERY OF MULTIPLE SHOCKS.  THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER, ANALYZED, AND TESTED OUT OF SPECIFICATION.

1720340;0;THIS EVENT OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE US.  ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED IS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  IF ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION IS RECEIVED, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED.  PATIENT INFORMATION IS NOT GENERALLY AVAILABLE DUE TO CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A MYOCARDIAL PERFORATION WAS FOUND ONE WEEK AFTER THE IMPLANTATION PROCEDURE. THE PERFORATION WAS FOUND ON A CT SCAN AND THE PHYSICIAN SUBSEQUENTLY EXPLANTED THE LEAD, REPAIRED THE MYOCARDIAL PERFORATION, AND RE-IMPLANTED A NEW LEAD. THERE WERE NO FURTHER COMPLICATIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.
1720392;1;DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. REPORTER INDICATED A VNS (B)(6) HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT HOLDING A CHARGE DUE TO THE A/C ADAPTER HAVING A LOOSE CONNECTION. THE COMPUTER HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR RETURN, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE.
1720406;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS FREEZING. PHYSICIAN WOULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION, DID NOT WANT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE SYSTEM, AND JUST WANTED A REPLACEMENT.

IF THE PRODUCT(S) ARE RETURNED, LFS WILL EVALUATE IT/THEM AND INFORM FDA OF PRODUCT(S) THAT DO NOT PASS INSPECTION IN A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.
1722166;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT KEEPING A CHARGE OR TURNING ON. THE INDICATOR LIGHT WAS SHOWING THAT THE DEVICE WAS CHARGING, BUT WOULD STILL NOT TURN ON. THE PHYSICIAN INDICATED THAT HE LEFT THE DEVICE PLUGGED IN FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND IT WOULD NOT TURN ON. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE DEVICE FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1722240;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PROCEDURE, THE INITIAL NAVIGATION WAS GOOD. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY SWITCHED TO LYMPH NODE MODE, IT APPEARED THAT THE LOCATABLE GUIDE SHIFTED IN ACCURACY. THEY COULD SEE ON THE MAIN BRONCHOSCOPY IMAGE WHERE THEIR LOCATION WAS BUT THE SYSTEM IMAGE WHERE THEIR LOCATION WAS BUT THE SYSTEM DID NOT SHOW THE SAME POSITION, IT APPEARED 2+CM AWAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CASE WAS COMPLETED FOR THE PERIPHERAL LESION BUT THE SHIFT IN THE VISUAL VERIFICATION WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR LYMPH NODE SAMPLING. THE PATIENT WAS UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PATIENT REPORTED. A SUPERDIMENSION REPRESENTATIVE WENT TO THE SITE ON (B)(4) 2010 TO EVALUATE THE SYSTEM. ACCURACY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS WERE PERFORMED AND PASSED. THE SYSTEM FUNCTION WAS NORMAL.
1722242;1;A SUPERDIMENSION REPRESENTATIVE WENT TO THE SITE TO EVALUATE THE SYSTEM AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE MOUSE THAT WAS BEING USED WAS NOT THE MOUSE THAT WAS INITIALLY INSTALLED WITH THE SYSTEM. THE MOUSE THAT WAS BEING USED WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PC. THE CASE WAS NOT COMPLETED WITH THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM WITH THE PATIENT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PATIENT, BUT IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION WE ARE FILING THIS MDR BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE EXPOSURES TO GENERAL ANESTHESIA. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PROCEDURE, THE SYSTEM GAVE AN ERROR MESSAGE FROM WINDOWS STATING IT HAD ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM AND HAD TO BE SHUT DOWN. THE COMPUTER SHUT ITSELF DOWN. THE PHYSICIAN RESTARTED IT AND ENCOUNTERED THE SAME MESSAGE AT THE LOGIN SCREEN. THEY DID A HARD SHUTDOWN AND RESTARTED, AGAIN ENCOUNTERING THE SAME MESSAGE. THE SUPERDIMENSION PORTION OF THE CASE WAS THEN ABORTED WITH THE PATIENT UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA.
1723015;0;PT WAS REVISED TO ADDRESS HIP PAIN. THIS COMPLAINT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. DEPUY WILL NOTIFY THE FDA OF THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION ONCE IT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
1723152;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A LEAD AND SYSTEM CHANGE OUT ON (B)(6) 2004. SHE HAD A PRIOR PERCUTANEOUS LEAD THAT WAS CAUSING A SHOCKING SENSATION WHICH COULD NO LONGER BE PROGRAMMED AROUND. PATIENT EXPERIENCED PARALYSIS POST SURGERY (SEE MANUFACTURER REPORT 6000153200600293) AND NOTED THAT THE DEVICE BROKE SHORTLY AFTER IMPLANT. SHE WAS ABLE TO USE THE STIMULATOR FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, BUT THEN STARTED HAVING A JOLTING IN THE ARM AGAIN. PROGRAMMING DID NOT RESOLVE ISSUE AND SHE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING ELSE DONE WITH THE SYSTEM. SHE REPORTED SHE WANTS THE SYSTEM REMOVED. THE PATIENT ALSO HAD PAIN WHERE THE LEADS WERE IN HER BACK AND AT THE NEUROSTIMULATOR SITE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. SHE HAD NOT REGAINED FULL STRENGTH AND FEELING SENSATION WAS STILL POOR ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THE PATIENT'S RSD HAD ALSO MOVED INTO THE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITIES. SHE HAD NOT STIMULATION SENSATION AND DESIRED TO HAVE THE DEVICE REMOVED. SHE WAS AT HOME IN FAIR CONDITION. (B)(4).
1723217;1;IT WAS REPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN THAT THEIR HANDHELD WAS FREEZING ON INTERROGATION SUCCESSFUL SCREEN. THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B)(6) HANDHELD COMPUTER. NEW HANDHELD IS BEING SHIPPED TO THE SITE AND THE OLD HANDHELD WAS RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. ANALYSIS ON THE FLASHCARD WAS COMPLETED AND THE SCREEN FREEZE EVENT IS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER. OTHER THAN THE ABOVE MENTIONED OBSERVATIONS, THE FLASHCARD AND SOFTWARE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT UNDER CERTAIN TYPE OF CONDITIONS THIS SCREEN FREEZE EVENT CAN OCCUR WITH THE (B)(6) HANDHELD COMPUTER. ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED ON THE HANDHELD AND NO ANOMALIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HANDHELD WERE NOTED DURING TESTING USING THE AC ADAPTER OF THE MAIN BATTERY WITH A FULL CHARGE.
1723886;0;IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION THAT A WALLFLEX BILIARY RX UNCOVERED STENT WAS INTENDED TO BE IMPLANTED WITHIN THE BILIARY TREE OF A PATIENT ON (B)(6), 2010 DURING AN ECHO-ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINANT, UPON UNPACKING OF THE DEVICE, IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE STENT WAS COVERED, INSTEAD OF UNCOVERED AS STATED ON THE PACKAGING. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER WALLFLEX BILIARY RX UNCOVERED STENT. THERE WERE NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. THE PATIENT CONDITION POST PROCEDURE WAS REPORTED TO BE FINE. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE DEVICE FOUND THE RETURNED STENT WAS AN UNCOVERED STENT AND MEASURED 8MM X 101MM WHICH WAS WITHIN SPECIFICATION. THE INNER PACKAGING OF THE STENT WAS ALSO RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INNER POUCH PACKAGE CORRESPONDED WITH THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS BATCH AS WELL AS THE SUSPECT DEVICE DETAILS GIVEN BY THE COMPLAINANT. BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE, THE INVESTIGATION WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM THE COMPLAINANTS' REPORT THAT 'THE STENT WAS COVERED, INSTEAD OF UNCOVERED AS STATED ON THE PACKAGING'.

ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION, WHEREBY, DUPLICATE RESULTS WERE RECEIVED BY THE PICIS EHR APPLICATION FROM AN ENTERPRISE INFO SYSTEM, WHICH, WHEN DISPLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SOME DEGREE OF CONFUSION FOR THE TREATING PHYSICIAN - THE CONTEXT OF WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS DECLINED TO CLARIFY ANY FURTHER. AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER THAT THEY ARE RESTRICTED BY SENIOR LEADERSHIP FROM DISCLOSING ANY SPECIFIC DETAILS REGARDING THE PATIENT'S STATUS, THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF RESULT OR EVIDENCE OF APPLICATION PERFORMANCE TO SUPPORT PICIS' INVESTIGATION. PICIS' INVESTIGATION INTO THE REPORTED INCIDENT IS BASED ON A LIMITED EXCHANGE OF INFO WITH THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS OUR INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION DESIGN AND CURRENT CONFIGURATION IN USE AT THE REPORTING SITE. REVIEW OF CONFIGURATION FILES, EXISTING SYSTEM BUILD AT THE CLIENT SITE, INTERFACE SPECIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND PREVIOUS CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CUSTOMER IMPLEMENTED AND ACCEPTED THE PICIS EDIS IN 2008. DURING THIS PROCESS, THE PICIS EDIS SYSTEM WAS CONFIGURED TO DISPLAY ALL RESULTS SENT FROM THE CUSTOMER'S ENTERPRISE SYSTEM RATHER THAN CONFIGURING THE RESULTS DISPLAY IN 'OVERWRITE' MODE. PRIOR TO ACCEPTANCE, AN INVESTIGATION BY PICIS AND THE CLIENT REVEALED THAT IT WAS THE SENDING SYSTEM, SENDING MULTIPLE DUPLICATE RESULTS MESSAGES AND A REQUEST WAS MADE BY THE CUSTOMER OF THAT ENTERPRISE VENDOR TO INVESTIGATE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM'S PROTOCOL FOR 'ADD ON' TESTS, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO UTILIZE THE 'OVERWRITE' CONFIGURATION DUE TO THE RISK OF FILTERING OUT UNIQUE RESULTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY NOT PRESENTING THE CLINICIANS WITH IMPORTANT INFO. THEREFORE, THE CUSTOMER ELECTED TO HAVE ALL RESULTS DISPLAYED. HOSPITALS ALSO ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ADD'L SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE FOR THE HANDLING OF CRITICAL RESULTS INCLUDING EXPEDITED REPORTING OF CRITICAL RESULTS WITH A LICENSED RESPONSIBLE CAREGIVER RATHER THAN RELYING SOLELY ON STANDARD RESULTS REPORTING PROCESSES (JOINT COMMISSION NATIONAL PATIENT SAFETY GOAL 02.03.01).

RESULTS: BIAS IN THE PARAMETER, USED IN THE LONGEVITY CALCULATION, LOADED INTO THE GENERATOR WAS IDENTIFIED. CONCLUSIONS: THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE BIAS IN THE PARAMETER USED IN THE LONGEVITY CALCULATION OF THE GENERATOR WAS DUE TO AN IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM OF THE LONGEVITY EQUATION REVISION USED TO ASSIGN THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER IN THE MFG TEST SYSTEM THAT INITIALIZES THE VALUE OF DIAGONCONSUMEDM IN THE GENERATOR. REVIEW OF THIS GENERATOR'S AS RECEIVED SOURCE CODE REVEALED THAT AN INCORRECT DIAGONCONSUMEDM VALUE, 4032, WAS STORED WITHIN THE GENERATOR. THE CORRECT DIAGONCONSUMEDM VALUE FOR A FREQUENCY OF 30 HZ AND PULSE WIDTH OF 500 MICROSECONDS IS 2984. THE PARAMETER DIAGONCONSUMEDM IS USED BY THE DEMIPULSE GENERATOR AND THE HANDHELD PROGRAMMER TO ESTIMATE DEVICE LONGEVITY. A DESIGN CHANGE IN THE EQUATION USED TO ASSIGN THE VALUE OF THIS PARAMETER WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE MFG TEST SYSTEM SOFTWARE THAT INITIALIZES THE VALUE OF DIAGONCONSUMEDM IN THE GENERATOR. THIS ROOT CAUSE LEADING TO THIS IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM RELATES TO DESIGN CHANGE CONTROL IN THAT THE INCORRECT ASSESSMENT THAT A PROGRAMMING EVENT EXECUTED LATER IN THE MFG PROCESS WOULD CORRECT THE VALUE OF DIAGONCONSUMEDM IN THE GENERATOR. THIS WAS CORRECTED FOR EXISTING INVENTORY THROUGH REWORK WHICH PERMANENTLY REVISED THE MFG TEST STATION SOFTWARE TO USE THE CORRECT PARAMETERS. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE BIAS IN DIAGONCONSUMEDM IS THAT A DESIGN CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE EQUATION THAT CALCULATES A PARAMETER (DIAGONCONSUMEDM IS THAT A DESIGN CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE EQUATION THAT CALCULATES A PARAMETER (DIAGONCONSUMEDM) IN THE LONGEVITY CALCULATION; A CORRESPONDING CHANGE WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE MFG TEST SYSTEM SOFTWARE."

1744041;1;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S VNS HANDHELD COMPUTER WAS NOT HOLDING A CHARGE ANYMORE. PHYSICIAN HAS ALWAYS KEPT IT PLUGGED IN WHENEVER HE IS NOT USING IT. NOW WHEN HE USES IT TO INTERROGATE UNPLUGGED, IT GOES THROUGH THE INTERROGATION HALF-WAY AND THEN THE SCREEN GOES BLACK AND THE HANDHELD TURNS OFF UNTIL IT IS PLUGGED IN AGAIN. HOWEVER, IF HE USES IT PLUGGED IN, IT CAUSES INTERFERENCE AND HAS DIFFICULTY INTERROGATING. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR AWHILE AND HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE.

1744498;1;IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT THE SITE THAT THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULTIES INTERROGATING SOME PATIENT'S DEVICES, WHICH WAS INTERMITTENT. A RESET OF THE HANDHELD COMPUTER DIDN'T RESOLVE THE ISSUE. WHEN THE SITE USED ANOTHER HHD, THE ISSUE APPEARED TO STILL BE PRESENT, BUT WAS RESOLVED WHEN THE PROGRAMMING WAND WAS ROTATED. IT IS BELIEVED BY THE SITE THAT THE ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE HHD, BUT ADEQUATE TROUBLESHOOTING HAS NOT COMPLETELY RULED OUT THE PROGRAMMING WAND OR SERIAL CABLES. IT WAS LATER NOTED THAT THE HHD WAS FREEZING UPON SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATION, WHICH WAS RESOLVED WITH A RESET OF THE DEVICE. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE SOFTWARE THAT IS RESOLVED WITH EITHER A SOFT OR HARD RESET OF THE DEVICE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1748892;0;CURRENTLY, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. THE DEVICE HAS BEEN RETURNED, BUT NOT YET EVALUATED. NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN AT THIS TIME. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL FOLLOW ONCE THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR DIABETES KETOACIDOSIS. THE BLOOD GLUCOSE READING WAS 323MG/DL. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS PERFORMED. REVIEWED PROGRAMMING AND THE DAILY TOTALS DO NOT MATCH THE BASAL/BOLUS HISTORY. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
1749473;1;ON (B)(6) 2010, THE CUSTOMER CALLED AND STATED THAT SHE COULD NOT FIND A SPECIFIC STUDY FOR A PATIENT. PRODUCT WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY AFTER THE COMPLAINT WAS TAKEN. THE DEVICE WAS EVALUATED REMOTELY, WE ACCESSED THE CUSTOMERS DATABASE.: SUMMARY OF EVALUATION: ON (B)(6) 2010, (B)(6), RAD TECH FROM THE CLINIC, CALLED AND STATED THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIND THE STUDIES FOR 2 SPECIFIC PATIENTS. STRYKER WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE STUDIES ON THE SYSTEM WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LOST. ON (B)(6) 2010, FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE ISSUE REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: DURING THE WEEK OF (B)(6) 2010, STRYKER REPRESENTATIVES ATTEMPTED TO UPGRADE THE CUSTOMER AT (B)(6) ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ((B)(6)) FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF THE OFFICE PACS SOFTWARE APPLICATION TO A NEWER VERSION BY SETTING UP DUAL SERVERS. ONE FOR LEGACY (3.4D) STUDIES AND ONE FOR NEW (POWER 4.1 SP3) STUDIES. THERE WAS ALSO AN UPGRADE EFFORT FOR THE EXTERNAL RAID ENCLOSURE HARDWARE TO GO FROM AN OUTDATED INLINE SYSTEM TO A NEW RAID STORAGE SYSTEM MADE BY IBM. THIS INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT DURING THE UPGRADE A NUMBER OF STUDIES WERE LOST FROM THE CUSTOMER'S DATA SET. THIS OCCURRED BETWEEN THE DATES OF (B)(6) 2010 THROUGH (B)(6) 2010 DURING WHICH THE CLINIC GENERATED PATIENT STUDIES. THE STUDIES WERE LOCALLY GENERATED AT THE CLINIC AND CONTAINED CR TYPE X-RAY IMAGES. AT THIS TIME IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE STUDY LOSS WAS DUE TO INCOMPLETE/INCORRECT TRANSFER OF OLD DATA OR DUE TO AN INVALID CONFIGURATION OF THE DUAL SYSTEM SETUP AT THE TIME. THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO INSUFFICIENT DATA TRANSFER PROCEDURES, THE LACK OF A DOCUMENTED PROCESS, AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION DURING UPGRADE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION AND FIDELITY OF CUSTOMER DATA. THE CLINIC HAS NOT REPORTED ANY PATIENT HARM AS A RESULT OF THE PATIENT DATA LOSS. THE LOST DATA IS COMPROMISED OF CR TYPE X-RAY STUDIES PERFORMED BETWEEN (B)(6) 2010 THROUGH (B)(6) 2010 ONLY.
1753065;1;THIS EVENT IS NOT PATIENT SPECIFIC, RATHER IT IS A SOFTWARE INTERACTION PROBLEM INVOLVING PHILIPS INTELLIVIEW PATIENT MONITOR SYSTEM AND MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICAL CHARTING SYSTEM. ISSUE IS THAT READINGS OF NIBP DO NOT ALWAYS CHART THE CORRECT NIPB VALUE WHEN THE HORIZON CLINICAL APPLICATION IS SET TO FILTER OR CHART THE VALUE EVERY 15, 30, 60, ETC. MINUTES.OUR PROBLEM IS THAT THE NIBP VALUE THAT SHOWS UP IN MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS IS THE VALUE FROM A MEASUREMENT TAKEN 15 MINUTES EARLIER.EXAMPLE: CLINICIAN STARTS AN NIBP READING AFTER SETTING THE PHILIPS INTELLEVIEW MONITOR (IN THIS CASE AN MP70) TO TAKE AN NIBP MEASUREMENT EVERY 15 MINUTES. THE CLINICIAN PUSHING THE NIBP START BUTTON AT 11:55. THE INTELLEVIEW MONITOR STARTS THE INFLATION OF THE CUFF, THEN STARTS DEFLATING, THEN DISPLAYS THE VALUE. THE TIME NOW IS 11:57. AT 12:00 MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS PERFORMS A QUERY AND RECEIVES THE NIBP VALUE. EVERYTHING IS GOOD, VALUES ARE CORRECT.THE PROBLEM NOW STARTS. THE PHILIPS INTELLEVIEW MONITOR WILL, OVER TIME, ROUND UP THE NIBP START TIME TO THE QUARTER HOUR (THIS IS A BUILT IN FEATURE OF THE SOFTWARE THE USER CANNOT DISABLE). SO FOR EXAMPLE, AN HOUR LATER, INSTEAD OF THE NIBP STARTING AT SAY 12:55, IT WILL NOW START THE NIBP MEASUREMENT AT 1:00. ALSO AT 1:00, MCKESSON HORIZON CLINICALS IS SET TO QUERYING FOR NIBP DATA FROM PHILIPS WHICH AT THIS EXACT POINT IN TIME HAS NOT COMPLETED THE NIBP MEASUREMENT AND THUS STILL HAS THE VALUE FROM THE 12:45 NIBP MEASUREMENT. THE NIBP MEASUREMENT STARTS AT THE QUARTER HOUR BUT DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE UNTIL THE MEASUREMENT HAS COMPLETED WHICH MIGHT TAKE ANYWHERE FROM 45 SECONDS TO 3 MINUTES DEPENDING ON IF THE MONITOR HAS TO RETRY 2 OR 3 TIMES, ETC.IN CRITICAL CARE AREAS PATIENTS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY FOR THE EFFICACY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY VASOACTIVE DRUGS. A DELAYED READING OF BLOOD PRESSURE COULD LEAD THE BEDSIDE NURSE TO ADJUST THE DOSAGE OF MEDICATION INCORRECTLY, LEADING TO POSSIBLE SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH.OUR BIOMED DEPT IS UNABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE DAS PROBLEM WORKING WITH EITHER MANUFACTURER, PHILIPS AND MCKESSON.THE FOLLOWING IS FROM AN E-MAIL COMMUNICATION WITH PHILIPS SUPPORT:CUSTOMER HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY PHILIPS SYSTEM SENDS NIBP DATA VIA HL7 TO MCKESSON CHARTING SYSTEM.HE HAS A LARGE SERVER NETWORK WITH 5 DBS AND 1 PATIENT LINK WITH MPX MONITORS. THE MPX MONITORS ARE CONFIGURED FOR AUTO NIBP MEASUREMENTS EVERY 15 MINUTES. THE MCKESSON SYSTEM QUERIES THE DBS OR PL ONCE EVERY MINUTE, HOWEVER IT APPLIES A FILTER TO THE NIBP DATA SO THAT THE NURSES VIEW IT ON THE CHARTING SYSTEM ONLY IN 15 MINUTE INTERVALS.THE PROBLEM IS THE MPX  MONITOR STARTS THE NIBP CLOCK WHEN THE PUMP STARTS, BUT IT MAY SOMETIMES TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO TO ACTUALLY GET A READING (DUE TO PATIENT-RELATED OR APPLICATION ISSUES). DURING THAT TIME MCKESSON WOULD HAVE QUERIED FOR THE DATA AND RECEIVED IT BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPLAY IN THE NURSES 15 MINUTE VIEW BECAUSE OF THAT 1-2 MINUTE LAG.AS A WORKAROUND, THE CUSTOMER HAS DISABLED THE EXTERNAL TIME SOURCE AT THE MASTER DBS AND HAS MANUALLY OFFSET THE TIME 1-2 MINUTES AHEAD AT THE MASTER DBS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE TIME DISCREPANCY OF THE NIBP MEASUREMENTS.THE CUSTOMER IS SUGGESTING THAT THE MPX MONITOR BE MODIFIED SO THAT ONCE IT DETECTS AN ACTIVE HL7 CONNECTION, IT SHOULD START THE NIBP PUMP 1-2 MINUTES EARLIER SO THAT THE DATA IS NOT MISSED ON THE DISPLAY VIEW AT THE MCKESSON CHARTING SYSTEM.THE CUSTOMER HAS ALSO RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT OTHER NON-PHILIPS SITES THAT (ANOTHER) VENDOR'S MONITORS DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ALLOW YOU TO OFFSET THE NIBP START TIME A LITTLE BIT.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY OF THESE PTS' PULSE GENERATORS, THUS DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS CANNOT BE RULED OUT. THIS MEDWATCH REPRESENTS ONE PT OUT OF THAT 48."
1810728;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT A HANDHELD COMPUTER FREEZES FOLLOWING INTERROGATION. TROUBLESHOOTING WAS REPORTED TO BE UNABLE IN RESOLVING THE ISSUE. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS FOR RETURN OF THE DEVICE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL TO DATE.
1810732;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE (B)(6) HANDHELD EXPERIENCED BATTERY FAILURE IN THE OPERATING ROOM. (B)(6) HANDHELD WAS REPLACED. ATTEMPTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ARE IN PROGRESS. DEVICE FAILURE IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1810748;1;"REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE SITE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE HANDHELD. ADDITIONALLY, REPORTER REVEALED THAT, ""THE SCREEN FREEZES EVERY TIME A 103 IS INTERROGATED."" ADDITIONALLY, HANDHELD AND THE FLASHCARD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BACK BY THE MANUFACTURER, AND ANALYSIS IS CURRENTLY BEING PERFORMED ON THE PRODUCTS."
1810753;0;"FROMES, GAIL. ""EFFICACY OF VAGUS NERVE STIMULATION IN ADULTS DURING 5 YEARS OF TREATMENT"". IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE VNS PATIENT DID NOT RECEIVE EFFICACY AFTER 5 YEARS OF VNS THERAPY. ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ARE UNDERWAY."
1810780;1;THE REPORTER INDICATED THAT AFTER INTERROGATION, THE (B)(6) PROGRAMMING COMPUTER SCREEN WOULD FREEZE UPON INTERROGATION AND PRIOR TO THE INTERROGATION RESULTS. THE REPORTER REMOVED THE FLASHCARD AND RE-INSERTED THE CARD INTO THE DEVICE WITH NO RESOLUTION. A SOFT AND HARD RESET WAS PERFORMED AS WELL. TROUBLESHOOTING DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE MFR HAS NOT RECEIVED THE HANDHELD OR PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE FOR PRODUCT ANALYSIS. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS FOR ADD'L INFO ARE IN PROGRESS AND AWAITING RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: DEVICE MALFUNCTION IS SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY.
1810781;1;REPORTER INDICATED THAT A (B)(6) HANDHELD COMPUTER'S SCREEN FROZE DURING INTERROGATION. RESEATING THE FLASHCARD AND RESETTING THE DEVICE DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. PRODUCT IS EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED TO THE MFR.
1810851;1;"DEVICE MALFUNCTION SUSPECTED, BUT DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THEY HAD A HANDHELD COMPUTER AND IT ""FREEZES UP"". GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE FOR PRODUCT RETURN AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS SURROUNDING THE EVENT."
1834019;0;IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE 9800 SYSTEM HAD POOR IMAGE QUALITY WITH BLANK IMAGES DURING A CASE. NO PATIENT INJURY WAS REPORTED.
1909030;0;"IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A GASTRECTOMY, THERE WAS AN ERROR SOUND. WHEN THE NURSE CLEANED AT THE TIP OF THE BLADE, IT WAS BROKEN. ANOTHER DEVICE WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE CASE. THERE WAS NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE TO THE PATIENT. (B)(4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: THE ANALYSIS RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DISTAL TIP OF THE BLADE BROKEN OFF, BUT PRESENT. THE REMAINING BLADE PORTION HAD SCRATCHES. THE IDENTIFIED BLADE DAMAGE MAY HAVE OCCURRED FROM EXTERNAL CONTACT DURING PRE-OP OR GENERAL USE. IN ADDITION, MINOR BLADE DAMAGE MAY INCREASE IN SEVERITY DURING SUBSEQUENT ACTIVATIONS, AND MAY RESULT IN BLADE ""LOCKOUT"" LATER IN THE PROCEDURE. THEREFORE, THE INSTRUCTIONAL INSERT STATES: ""AVOID ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH ALL METAL OR PLASTIC INSTRUMENTS OR OBJECTS WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS ACTIVATED. CONTACT WITH STAPLES, CLIPS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS WHILE THE INSTRUMENT IS ACTIVATED MAY RESULT IN CRACKED OR BROKEN BLADES, WHICH MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY GENERATOR SOLID TONE OR INSTRUMENT ERROR."" EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT, AND DAMAGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED AT THIS PROCESS. WE HAVE DOCUMENTED THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS THEY WERE REPORTED TO US. IN ADDITION, COMPLAINT INFORMATION IS TRENDED ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. THE BATCH HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS."
2123202;1;CUSTOMER CALLED TO INFORM US THAT MARKING TEXT ADDED TO THE IMAGE AT THE MODALITY AS AN OVERLAY WAS NOT DISPLAYING IN ISITE PACS. NO REPORT OF PT INJURY OR HARM. WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THIS DEFECT, AND THAT IT IS SPECIFIC TO ISITE PACS V 3.5.83 CLIENT. WHILE SYSTEMIC, THIS IS ISOLATE TO ONE CUSTOMER, AS THEY WERE THE FIRST AND ONLY CUSTOMER TO UPGRADE TO THIS SOFTWARE VERSION. CUSTOMER IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND WE WORKED WITH THEM TO PROVIDE MITIGATION THROUGH A WORKAROUND UNTIL WHICH TIME THEY CAN BE UPGRADED TO A CORRECTED VERSION. NO FURTHER ACTION REQUIRED.
2181932;1;"THIS X-RAY SYSTEM WILL INTERMITTENTLY EXPORT FLIPPED IMAGES TO THE PICTURE ARCHIVING COMPUTER SYSTEM (PACS). THESE FLIPPED IMAGES REFERS TO IMAGE INVERSION AND CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ""MIRRORED"" WHERE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARE REVERSED. INVERTED WOULD APPLY TO THE TOP AND BOTTOM BEING REVERSED. THE RANDOM CHANGES IN THE IMAGE ORIENTATION COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE FOUR POSSIBLE ORIENTATION ERRORS. A REBOOT OF THE SYSTEM WILL TEMPORALLY RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION. (CONCLUSIONS): THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS A SOFTWARE RELATED ISSUE. A FIELD CHANGE ORDER WILL BE RELEASED TO CORRECT THIS SOFTWARE ISSUE."
2523071;1;"AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE DATABASE WAS CONFIGURED WITH ""AUTO TURNING"" TURNED ON. THE DATABASE RAN OUT OF RESOURCES AND COULD NOT HANDLE THE TRANSACTIONS AT THAT TIME. THE IMPORTING DEVICE'S ERROR HANDLING ONLY REPORTED THE UNDERLYING DATABASE PROBLEM IN THE LOG FILES WITHOUT MARKING THE MISSING IMAGES AS ""FAILED TO IMPORT"". THUS, THE IMPORTING DEVICE MOVED TO CLOSE THE STUDY WITHOUT LEAVING THE FAILED IMAGES TO BE RE-TRIED. THE DICOM DELETION CODE SHOULD NOT HAVE DELETED THE DICOM IMAGES THAT ARE FAILED. INSTEAD, IT SHOULD LEAVE THE IMAGES SO THEY CAN BE RE-TRIED. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED IN V6, CU4 AND INSTALLED. ALL IMAGES SENT TO THE AMICAS VER. 6 SERVER ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO REVIEW."
2548239;1;"INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED TO THEIR MFG CONSULTANT THAT THEIR (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER ""WHEN HE TURNS ON THE DEVICE HE CONTINUES TO HAVE TO ALIGN THE SCREEN AND CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT SCREEN."" THE (B)(4) HANDHELD COMPUTER IS AT THE MFR PENDING COMPLETION OF PRODUCT ANALYSIS."
2625578;1;INITIAL EVALUATION OF THIS ISSUE SUGGESTED THAT THE ISSUE WAS A REBOOT ISSUE, NOT LIKELY TO CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT AFTER UPGRADING THEIR SOFTWARE TO L.00.18, THEY WERE STILL GETTING INTERMITTENT REBOOTS WHEN THE 12 LEAD OPTION WAS ENABLED. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY PRODUCT SUPPORT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PIC WAS ACTUALLY REBOOTING WHEN CONFIGURED FOR 'LONG YELLOW ALARM' AND THE HEART RATE EXCEEDED EITHER THE HIGH OR LOW ALARM LIMITS. THIS IS A REPORT OF THE SAME SOFTWARE MALFUNCTION PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO THE FDA VIA MDR #1218950-2009-02166 ON (B)(4), 2009 FOR A DIFFERENT SERVICED DEVICE AT THIS INSTITUTION. IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE A SOFTWARE DEFECT THAT ONLY IMPACTS (B)(4) LANGUAGE VERSIONS. THIS ISSUE IS CORRECTED IN SOFTWARE PATCH L.00.19 WHICH WAS RELEASED VIA (B)(4) AND THE FDA WAS INFORMED ON (B)(4), 2009. THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES FOR THE TWO INVOLVED MARKETS WERE NOTIFIED OF THE SOFTWARE CHANGE ON (B)(4), 2009. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION/ACTION IS WARRANTED. (B)(4).
2627477;1;"NO ADVERSE EVENT, MISDIAGNOSIS, OR PATIENT MISMANAGEMENT HAS BEEN REPORTED. HOWEVER, A CUSTOMER SITE HAS NOTIFIED PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR THAT IT DETECTED A SOFTWARE DEFECT WITH ITS CARDIOLOGY PACS SOFTWARE WHEN EXPORTING A PT'S DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES TO A CD. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE DETERMINED THERE IS A REMOTE POTENTIAL OF A POSSIBLE ADVERSE EVENT IF THIS DEFECT WAS ENCOUNTERED AND WENT UNDETECTED BY A USER AT ANOTHER SITE. THE CUSTOMER SITE REPORTED AN ISSUE WITH THE ""(B)(4) STUDY"" FEATURE OF THE COMPANY'S CARDIOLOGY PACS MEDICAL SOFTWARE WHEN MORE THAN ONE PT IS LOADED AND BEING VIEWED ON THE PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR CLIENT SOFTWARE APPLICATION. IF AN IMAGE FOR PT #1 IS LOADED AND BEING VIEWED ON THE PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR CLIENT SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND THE USER LOADS AN IMAGE OF PT #2 TO EXPORT CD/DVD, THE CLIENT SOFTWARE EXPORTS THE IMAGE OF PT #1 INSTEAD OF THE IMAGE FOR PT #2, BUT LABELS IT AS BELONGING TO PT #2. THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE CUSTOMER SITE, A TEACHING INSTITUTION, WHILE PREPARING A CD/DVD FOR A CASE PRESENTATION FOR A CARDIOLOGY FELLOW (PHYSICIAN IN TRAINING). THERE WAS NO CLINICAL IMPACT DUE TO THE FACT THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO THE USE OF THE CD AND IT WAS TO BE USED FOR TEACHING PURPOSES. UPON NOTIFICATION BY THE CUSTOMER SITE, THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DEFECT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ISSUE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE SOFTWARE BEGINNING WITH VERSION 3.5.1530 WHICH WAS RELEASED ON (B)(4) 2007. DESPITE THIS FACT, THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT OF THE ISSUE BEING MANIFESTED BY ANY CUSTOMER SITE. IN THE CASE DESCRIBED IN THIS FORM, THE EXPORT WOULD CONTAIN THE INCORRECT PT DEMOGRAPHICS (I.E., NAME/DATE OF STUDY) DISPLAY AS AN OVERLAY ON THE IMAGES. WITH RESPECT TO ULTRASOUND (ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY AND VASCULAR) AND NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY IMAGES, THE PT DEMOGRAPHICS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE EXPORTED IMAGE BY THE SENDING DEVICE, SO UPON INSPECTION A USER SHOULD NOTICE THE INCORRECT DEMOGRAPHICS. FOR CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION IMAGES, THERE IS NO OTHER PT IDENTIFYING INFO ON THE EXPORTED IMAGE. BASED UPON THE FOREGOING, AND BEGINNING (B)(4) 2008, THE COMPANY CONTACTED ALL CUSTOMER SITES USING AFFECTED VERSIONS OF PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR IN A CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LAB ENVIRONMENT TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION OF THE ISSUE AND TO DESCRIBE THE PROPER PREVENTATIVE ACTION (I.E., USERS MUST ONLY HAVE ONE STUDY LOADED AND VIEWED WHEN EXPORTING TO CD/DVD). A FOLLOW-UP LETTER WAS SENT TO THESE CUSTOMER SITES, WITH PROOF OF RECEIPT. A SIMILAR LETTER WILL BE SENT TO ALL OTHER AFFECTED SITES (I.E., CUSTOMER SITES THAT ARE NOT USING PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR IN A CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LAB ENVIRONMENT) WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS. A SOFTWARE PATCH FOR THE AFFECTED VERSIONS, VERSIONS 3.5.1530, 3.5.1776 AND 4.0.142, IS TARGETED FOR RELEASE ON OR BEFORE (B)(4) 2009, AND WILL BE LABELED AS PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR 3.5.1530.12, PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR 3.5.1776.28 AND PROSOLV CARDIOVASCULAR 4.0.142.57 RESPECTIVELY. ONCE RELEASED, THESE SOFTWARE PATCHES WILL BE OFFERED AND DEPLOYED TO ALL AFFECTED CUSTOMER SITES."
2655869;1;AS A PRECAUTION, A COMPONENT OF THE SUPERDIMENSION SYSTEM, THE PT SENSOR TRIPLET (PST) WAS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM AND REPLACED. HOWEVER, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE LOOSE CONNECTION TO THE PT SENSOR PATCH MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OF THE REPORTED ISSUE. THE CUSTOMER RECEIVED A NEW PT SENSOR TRIPLET AS A REPLACEMENT. AT THIS TIME, SUPERDIMENSION HAS NOT YET RECEIVED AND OR PROCESSED THE RETURN. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTED THAT HE HAD DIFFICULTY REGISTERING THE PT BECAUSE HE WAS RECEIVING THE ERROR MESSAGE REGARDING MIS-MATCHED POINTS SEVERAL TIMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCATABLE GUIDE TIP APPEARING OUT OF THE AIRWAY WHEN TOUCHING THE MAIN CARINA. THEY DID NOT PROCEED WITH THE SUPERDIMENSION PORTION OF THE PROCEDURE, INSTEAD THEY COMPLETED THE CASE BY OTHER MEANS. AFTER THE PROCEDURE WHEN THEY WENT TO REMOVE THE PST CABLE FROM THE PT, THEY FOUND THE SENSOR ON THE RIGHT SIDE WAS LOOSE/BARELY ATTACHED TO THE PT SENSOR PATCH AND MOVING AROUND QUITE A BIT. THERE WAS NO HARM OR INJURY TO THE PT REPORTED.
2690079;1;CONCLUSION: THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM IS A SOFTWARE RELATED ISSUE. A FIELD CHANGE ORDER WILL BE RELEASED TO CORRECT THIS SOFTWARE ISSUE. THIS X-RAY SYSTEM WILL INTERMITTENTLY EXPORT FLIPPED IMAGES TO THE PICTURE ARCHIVING COMPUTER SYSTEM (PACS). THESE FLIPPED IMAGES REFERS TO IMAGE INVERSION AND CAN BE DESCRIBED AS �MIRRORED� WHERE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARE REVERSED. INVERTED WOULD APPLY TO THE TOP AND BOTTOM BEING REVERSED. THE RANDOM CHANGES IN THE IMAGE ORIENTATION COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE FOUR POSSIBLE ORIENTATION ERRORS. A REBOOT OF THE SYSTEM WILL TEMPORARILY RESTORE NORMAL OPERATION.
